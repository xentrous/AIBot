1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,872
Chandler, you're doing so well
with this whole getting married...

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:11,533
...never gonna sleep with anyone for the
rest of your life thing. I thinks it's great.

3
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:16,479
- Hey. Who wants French toast?
- I'll have some.

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,685
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

5
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,219
- What's the matter?
- My hand feels weird.

6
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,254
I guess it's because I'm engaged!

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,562
- When will that start getting annoying?
- Start?

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,998
Let's start the wedding plans.

9
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,326
- Okay.
- Already?

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,469
We got a lot to do. We gotta think
about the flowers, the music...

11
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,435
- I have thoughts on the music...
- Chandler. Too many cooks.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,212
Take it from me. All you have to do is
show up and try to say the right name.

13
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,617
- What in God's name is that?
- Oh, my God, the wedding book?

14
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,152
I haven't seen that since fourth grade.

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,257
This baby has everything. Take,
you know, locations, for instance:

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,125
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,528
...then by square footage.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,334
That is so smart.

19
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,904
Break it off. Break it off now.

20
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,743
Look, here's the invitation you used to your
wedding to John Lynch in the fifth grade.

21
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,713
Remember how I got sick and
Ross had to fill in as a bridesmaid?

22
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,051
I was a brides-boy.

23
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,115
I don't smell French toast, brides-boy.

24
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,920
The One With Rachel's Book

25
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,096
That conclusively proves...

26
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,958
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,760
Let's take a look...

28
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,230
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

29
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,841
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

30
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,375
Oh, my God. Of course.

31
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,213
Would you please excuse me
for a moment?

32
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,917
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you...?

33
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,185
What's going on?

34
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,791
Well, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged...

35
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,187
...it would be nice
if they have privacy.

36
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,888
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

37
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:53,294
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

38
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,599
Nothing. Why?

39
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,209
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

40
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,437
Yeah, it is.
My movie starts in, like, five minutes.

41
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,477
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

42
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,183
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

43
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,161
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents...

44
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,435
...but tell me how this is for music:

45
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,236
A string quartet for the processional,
a jazz trio for cocktails...

46
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,634
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing...

47
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,639
Wait, that was
for my sixth grade wedding.

48
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,239
You couldn't get them anyway. Ian
doesn't even play anymore and Derek...

49
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,516
Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

50
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,156
Mon, do you have another pillow,
something a little snugglier?

51
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,427
Why are you napping here
instead of at your place?

52
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,630
- The duck.
- What... The duck?

53
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,094
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

54
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,267
Well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

55
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,633
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

56
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,441
Do I get to look at this book...

57
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,772
...or is it just for people
involved in the wedding?

58
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,514
Of course you can look at it.
I want your opinion.

59
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,809
Here you go.

60
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,453
- What about centerpieces?
- Centerpieces!

61
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,556
- Roses or lilies?
- Definitely roses.

62
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,697
I think they're more "wedding-y."

63
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,363
- But lilies are the clear choice.
- Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

64
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,074
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,704
I'm gonna get cranky.

66
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,879
Joey, there's a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

67
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,311
Yes, it is perfectly good...

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,885
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,890
What?

70
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,188
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Joey, what did the duck do?

71
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,295
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

72
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,741
Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,544
What the hell is in that face cream?

74
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,726
That's so soft.

75
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,330
Pillowcases!

76
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:59,048
"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
Her father, the vicar..."

77
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,519
Vicar?

78
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,955
"...wouldn't be home for hours.

79
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,028
Her loins were burning.

80
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:11,168
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his..."

81
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,773
This is a dirty book!

82
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,749
Phoebe?

83
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,524
Oh, Ross, hi.

84
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,788
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Sorry, I'm with a client right now.

85
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,134
- Phoebe!
- Okay, let's talk outside.

86
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,805
Unfortunately, this time will be
counted as part of your massage.

87
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,340
So try...

88
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,740
...and think relaxing thoughts.

89
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,040
And don't touch any of my dinosaurs.

90
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,310
I know they're cool, but they're mine.

91
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,086
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

92
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,722
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

93
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,485
And they knew about it?

94
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
Okay, Ross, what is this really about?

95
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,931
This is my home and I want to be
able to come and go when I want.

96
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,404
I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

97
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,301
I don't know what the big deal is.

98
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,378
I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

99
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,607
...when I want to kick back
with a puzzle... Beer, cold beer.

100
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,320
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

101
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,386
Sweeping. Why?
Does it turn you on?

102
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,621
No.

103
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,867
What if I was sweeping a chimney?

104
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,904
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

105
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,838
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

106
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,319
Joey, where did you learn that word?

107
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,449
Where do you think...

108
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,160
...Zelda?

109
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,058
- You found my book?!
- Yeah, I did!

110
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,935
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

111
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:29,038
I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!

112
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,876
God! I cannot believe you invaded
my privacy like that!

113
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,742
Zelda.

114
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:41,379
Now, you seem a little tense. Maybe
you'll relax if I gave you a nice milk bath.

115
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,555
Okay, you know what?

116
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,888
- I don't even like that part.
- Oh, I do.

117
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,221
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

118
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:56,161
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

119
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,098
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

120
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,139
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

121
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,102
You got porn.

122
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,766
- Hello.
- Hi, is Phoebe here?

123
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,737
- No, she's out for the night.
- Oh, great.

124
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,774
Can I help you with something?

125
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,908
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

126
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,945
Yes, I am.

127
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,115
Great! Dad?

128
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,290
Thank you so much.
I'll pick him up in an hour.

129
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,265
You need help with that?

130
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,904
Your parents must've been thrilled
when you told them you were engaged.

131
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,242
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

132
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,413
I remember when we first got engaged.

133
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,680
- I've never heard that story.
- Dad, you don't...

134
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,017
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

135
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,220
I still don't know how.

136
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,896
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

137
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,531
What a sweet story.

138
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,302
At least you're not hearing it
at your fifth grade Halloween party.

139
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,099
They wanted a scary story.

140
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,942
We're really excited
about our wedding plans.

141
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,184
I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

142
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,248
- What?
- You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

143
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,925
You have the wedding fund, don't you?

144
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,222
We have it.
Only, now we call it "the beach house."

145
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,492
You spent my wedding
fund on the beach house?

146
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,136
We're sorry. We assumed...

147
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,034
...that if you got married after 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

148
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,772
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

149
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,169
So you've had seven years
of beach fun...

150
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,539
...and you can't put a price on that.

151
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,848
We do feel bad about this.

152
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,816
We saved again
when you dated Richard...

153
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,590
...then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

154
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,793
What about Chandler?

155
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,258
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd propose.

156
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,064
Clearly I did not start drinking
enough at the start of the meal.

157
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,039
I can't believe there's no money
for my wedding.

158
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,207
Maybe, if your father hadn't tried...

159
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,035
...to sell ice over the Internet.

160
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,736
- It seemed like such a simple idea.
- Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

161
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,040
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.

162
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,615
Good luck, Chandler.

163
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,073
Okay, now I'm going to...

164
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,275
...touch you.

165
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,023
That's soft.

166
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,656
Why does Joey keep talking
about chimney sweeps and vicars?

167
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,494
I thinks he's just been rehearsing
for an episode of his show.

168
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,262
Because it really sounds
like a bad porn novel.

169
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,935
Do you think your parents
could help pay for it?

170
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,074
I don't know.

171
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,337
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

172
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,776
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

173
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:42,577
And any extra cash my father has
he saves for his yearly trips to...

174
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,650
...Dollywood.

175
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,293
- What happened at dinner?
- My parents spent the wedding fund.

176
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,530
My God, what did you order?

177
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,437
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

178
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,004
You guys are gonna have to get
married in, like, a rec center.

179
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,670
Oh, my God, you're right.

180
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:10,110
We're gonna have to be out by 6 so they
can take out the floor for senior swim.

181
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,708
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay.

182
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,283
- No swing band, no lilies.
- No, but that's good.

183
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,652
You don't want lilies.

184
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,489
If a cat ate them, it would die.

185
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:31,266
- What?
- I'm just saying, now you could invite cats.

186
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,904
It's gonna be okay.

187
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,701
I mean, you don't need to have this...

188
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,673
...rustic Italian feast.

189
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,971
You don't need this custom-made...

190
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,083
...empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

191
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,944
You can wear off-the-rack.

192
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,693
It's really gonna be okay.

193
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,864
The important thing is that we love each
other and we're gonna get married.

194
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,623
Do you even understand what
"off-the-rack" means?

195
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,368
Why don't you pay for it yourself?

196
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,005
How? I don't have any money.

197
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,140
- Well, I have some.
- How much?

198
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,344
Well, close to...

199
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,625
- Are you kidding me?!
- How much?

200
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,589
- Enough for wedding scenario A.
- Really?

201
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:35,125
Scenario A has lilies. Someone's gonna have
to break it to the cats and it won't be me.

202
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,693
How great are you, you little saver!

203
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,871
This is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

204
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,872
You guys are so made for each other.

205
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,276
You're not suggesting that we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

206
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,981
Yeah.

207
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,011
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

208
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:00,282
...and I kind of had some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

209
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,984
Hello, Mr. Chandler.

210
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,032
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

211
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,966
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

212
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,332
Honey, I love you.

213
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,873
But if you call our wedding
a party one more time...

214
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,611
...you may not get invited.

215
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,049
We can always earn more money.
We're only gonna get married once.

216
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,518
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.

217
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,818
You're gonna have to
"put your foot down"?

218
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,256
Yes, I am.

219
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,201
Money and a firm hand.

220
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,903
Finally a Chandler I
can get on board with.

221
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,511
- Hey, Rach.
- Joey.

222
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,777
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

223
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,081
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

224
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,021
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

225
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,886
Something's on fire.

226
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,958
No, I don't smell anything.

227
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,762
Oh, you know what? It's probably
just your burning loins.

228
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,171
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

229
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,542
Damn, this coffee's cold.

230
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,807
Do you mind if I heat this up
on your loins?

231
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,248
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey...

232
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,717
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.

233
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,431
Yeah, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

234
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,094
Oh, yeah?

235
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,132
Well, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

236
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,298
What's up?

237
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,506
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

238
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,709
Excuse me, ladies.

239
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,116
I'm sorry?

240
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,547
My massage client, Arthur.

241
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,586
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me...

242
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,622
...gave him a really weird massage.

243
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,590
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

244
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,097
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

245
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,927
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

246
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,138
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

247
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,365
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

248
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,174
Well, he's never coming back.
You just cost me $80 a week.

249
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,408
This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

250
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,414
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

251
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,611
You could've sent him away.

252
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,790
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

253
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,919
He said he liked that!

254
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,166
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,562
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

256
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,005
- His daughter was hot.
- Gotcha.

257
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,774
Look, Ross,
I really need that $80 every week.

258
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm sure you'll find
another massage client, Phoebe.

259
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,110
Yeah, I'm sure I will too. But until then,
I'm going to massage you every week...

260
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,086
...for the price of $ 100.
- You just said 80.

261
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,157
You want me to mess up your puzzle?

262
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,386
A hundred it is.

263
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,832
Hello, Zelda.

264
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,837
- Who are you supposed to be?
- The vicar.

265
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,482
- Do you even know what a vicar is?
- Like a goalie, right?

266
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,087
Look, that's enough.

267
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,689
The joke's over. I'm sick of it.

268
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,383
You mean this isn't the sweet torment
you've been waiting all your life for?

269
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,961
Joey, I'm serious,
all right? It's enough.

270
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,031
You make stupid jokes
and sleazy innuendoes...

271
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,064
...and it's just not funny anymore.

272
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,397
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.

273
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,769
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

274
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,543
All right, that's it.
You wanna do it? Let's do it.

275
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,216
That's right.
I wanna do it with you.

276
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:28,426
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

277
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,819
I did?

278
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,256
Yeah. Oh, I've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

279
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,631
- This body?
- Yeah, that's right.

280
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,834
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

281
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,540
You're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.

282
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,908
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Get those clothes off.

283
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,104
But I'd keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

284
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,013
I don't want to. I'm scared.

285
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,250
Listen...

286
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,432
...I've been thinking.

287
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,796
It's not fair of me to ask you to
spend all of your money on our wedding.

288
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,868
I mean, you work really hard for that.

289
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,208
- Well.
- Well, you work for that.

290
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,712
Look, I've thought about it too.

291
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,178
I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

292
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,848
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

293
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,184
Look, when I proposed,
I told you...

294
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,691
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

295
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,161
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

296
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,425
...then that's what we're gonna do.

297
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,134
You are so sweet.

298
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,944
What about the future and stuff?

299
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,340
Forget about the future and stuff.

300
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,877
So we only have two kids.

301
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,711
We'll pick our favorite and
that one will get to go to college.

302
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,222
- Have you thought about that?
- Yeah.

303
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,980
How many kids were we gonna have?

304
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,820
Four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

305
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,292
What else did you think about?

306
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,397
Well, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

307
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,194
Like a small place outside the city...

308
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,499
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes.

309
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,437
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

310
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,010
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

311
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:35,083
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

312
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,552
You know what?

313
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,286
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

314
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,726
- Sure you do.
- No.

315
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,828
I want everything that you've
just said. I want a marriage.

316
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,237
You sure?

317
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,970
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

318
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,615
When you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

319
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,550
But you meant dog, right?

320
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,826
- Yeah, totally.
- Oh, good.

321
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,163
Room temperature okay?

322
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,434
- Excellent. Is the music too loud?
- No.

323
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,835
Good.

324
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,272
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,213
Were you expecting a traditional
massage with the hands?

326
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,581
Fine.

327
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,654
Now, just try to relax.
