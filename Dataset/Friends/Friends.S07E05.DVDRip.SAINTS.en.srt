1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,263
- What's the matter?
- Somebody on the subway licked my neck!

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,499
Willy's still alive!

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,409
- What are you guys doing?
- My mom called.

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,705
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,975
- We're looking for a good picture of us.
- I'm afraid that does not exist.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,649
There are great pictures of us.

7
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,892
No, there are great pictures of you standing
next to a guy who's going like this:

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:32,388
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,702
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,062
Here's a great one.

11
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,331
- Yeah, I'm not in that.
- No, but look at me, all tan.

12
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,906
Why don't you go get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

13
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,704
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

14
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,681
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,549
- Chandler, what do you say?
- All right, but I'm not going.

16
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,488
"I'm" going.

17
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,290
The One With The
Engagement Picture

18
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,690
Dude, that reverse lay-up.

19
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,060
- And how about those three-pointers?
- Amazing.

20
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,033
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

21
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,335
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,117
You call him, "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him, "Hums While He Pees."

23
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,687
Yes, and we call Ross,
"Lingers in the Bathroom."

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,088
Hey, you guys, Hums While He Pees
just asked me out!

25
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,563
- I thought that guy was married.
- He is, but he's getting divorced.

26
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,354
Ross, maybe you know him.

27
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,725
It's not a club.

28
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,733
If he's getting a divorce,
is it such a good idea to date him?

29
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,507
- Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
- They have that on the napkins at the club.

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,480
- I gotta get back to work.
- You don't have to be back for a half-hour.

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,116
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch.

32
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,283
I could just spread him on a cracker.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,487
You have a crush on him,
why would you hire him?

34
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,492
- You know you can't date him, right?
- Oh, no, I know that.

35
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,562
We made a joke that we spend
so much time together...

36
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,426
...he should call me, his "work-wife."

37
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,108
Soon he'll be able to call you, "that
lady he knew that got fired."

38
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,814
I'm not gonna get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

39
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,175
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone else?

40
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:09,787
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

41
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,390
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,961
Dude, that's so sad.

43
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,129
I could put a basketball court
in the back.

44
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,994
Could I play?

45
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,307
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,039
- I just did them.
- Well, drop and give me 10 more.

47
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,509
What?

48
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,545
I had a drink with lunch.

49
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,215
- Did those cost reports come in?
- I filled them out last night.

50
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,183
Could you make me four copies?

51
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,119
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

52
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,876
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi, Melissa. What's up?

53
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,915
I'm just about to go out to the store.

54
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,643
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

55
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,516
Dried fruit, and granola
and stuff like that.

56
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,554
- What's up?
- Is Tag here?

57
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,794
No. Why?

58
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,393
I was gonna talk to him
about tonight.

59
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,727
Really? You got a little crush
on Tag there, do you?

60
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,627
We've been flirting back and forth...

61
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,738
...but I was hoping tonight it would turn
into something a little more than that.

62
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,842
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

63
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,516
But, you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,147
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,921
All right, back to work.

66
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,822
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

67
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,932
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.

68
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,772
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

69
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,774
Now, Chandler, you want to
give us a smile?

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,206
Okay.

71
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,982
- I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
- No, I am.

72
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,616
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

73
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,950
- I do?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,554
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,030
- Try looking sexy.
- Okay.

76
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,974
Or not.

77
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,010
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

78
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,812
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce on my shirt.

79
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,986
- You got an extra one?
- Yeah, sure.

80
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,786
Here.

81
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,324
Great.

82
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,630
You got anything that's
not Ralph Lauren?

83
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,093
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

84
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,637
I guess this'll be fine.

85
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,001
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing. Why?

86
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,280
How would you feel about
taking out my assistant, Tag? I'll pay.

87
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,375
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

88
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,651
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

89
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,687
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

90
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,222
He's new in town, and I know
he doesn't have any guy friends.

91
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,398
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd really appreciate it.

92
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,697
- Yeah, okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

93
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,267
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

94
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,582
You got a red shirt?

95
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,151
I know. Let's try a look...

96
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,654
...of far-off wonderment.

97
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:14,194
Gaze into our future, and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

98
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,798
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

99
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,806
This picture should say,
"Geller and Bing to be married,"...

100
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,979
...not, "Local woman saves
drowning moron."

101
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,108
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

102
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,322
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

103
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,986
I like this one.

104
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,926
It seems to say, "I love you and
that's why I have to kill you."

105
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,701
Can't all be bad.

106
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,967
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

107
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,339
There it is.

108
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,839
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

109
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,673
Why did you ever sleep with me?

110
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,217
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

111
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,623
- I'm really having a good time.
- Me too.

112
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,621
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

113
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,190
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

114
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,527
I don't mean to be presumptuous...

115
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,600
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

116
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,466
Yeah, I...

117
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,698
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

118
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,713
I know that it's really lame, but I got
these tickets from my boss...

119
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,448
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

120
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,708
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

121
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,843
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

122
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,884
I cannot deal with her now.
That woman is crazy.

123
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,614
Okay, I know. Hold on.

124
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,194
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,596
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife,
out there.

126
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,392
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

127
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,533
What? No.

128
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,473
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the ballroom-dance finals.

129
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,437
I don't think so, Pheebs.

130
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,078
All right, I'll do it.

131
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,812
- But just because you're a friend.
- Okay.

132
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,096
Hi, Ginger.

133
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,894
I want my key back.

134
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,470
- I don't have it.
- It's right there.

135
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,873
Okay, Sherlock.

136
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,711
I'm sorry,
but you'd better go, Pheebs.

137
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,913
I just wanted to thank you, though,
for diverting Kyle's ex.

138
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,911
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.

139
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,417
- Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Ross.

140
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,048
- Are you ready for breakfast?
- Yep.

141
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,263
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

142
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,563
Can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

143
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,033
...who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

144
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,336
- Sure.
- Okay.

145
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,868
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

146
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,604
Watching ballroom dancing?

147
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,716
Yes, that's where we realized
we were both super-cool people.

148
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,784
Look, Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

149
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,557
- Like what?
- Like she's really mean...

150
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,784
...and she's overly critical and...

151
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,896
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

152
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,762
Okay.

153
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,103
And she uses sex as a weapon.

154
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,704
Thank you for warning me.

155
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,606
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
room painting and sex weapons.

156
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,280
- You're still gonna go out with her?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,848
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

158
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,984
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

159
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,986
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me.

160
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,388
Listen to me, she is crazy!

161
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,226
Your door isn't soundproof.

162
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,136
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

163
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,704
- Excuse me.
- He's not here!

164
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,048
My God, do you people have
nothing better to do...

165
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,688
...than to traipse into my office
and just gawk at my assistant.

166
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,686
I'm Emily from upstairs.

167
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,157
Susan's still in the hospital, and I'm
collecting money to send her flowers.

168
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,160
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay. Yes, of course.

169
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,234
Just take it all. Take it all. And
please, please, give my best to Emily.

170
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,937
I'm Emily.

171
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,737
Yeah. No, I meant...

172
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,770
...the other one that you said.

173
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,542
- Morning.
- Hi, Tag.

174
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:02,117
- Did you have fun with Joey last night?
- Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

175
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,983
That's nice.

176
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,723
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

177
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,756
Women? You mean, like old women?

178
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,592
Kind of old, like 30.

179
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,909
I never used to be able
to just talk to girls in bars...

180
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,238
...but I got like 20 phone numbers
last night.

181
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,514
That's great.

182
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,118
Joey must have really taught
you some stuff.

183
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,387
A little.

184
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,525
How you doing?

185
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,436
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

186
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,398
Now pretend I have a camera.

187
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,741
- You're changing it.
- I can't help it.

188
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,241
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

189
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,311
Borrow money from me?

190
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,953
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

191
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,521
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

192
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,124
Then I look up.

193
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,195
See? Now you try.

194
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,559
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

195
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,735
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

196
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,968
I had a doughnut.

197
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,635
So I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

198
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,039
Yeah, that guy's all right.

199
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,182
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey."

200
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,119
- What?
- You know, all the women.

201
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,151
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

202
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,688
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

203
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm right here.

204
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,533
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

205
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,935
Just the idea of you, and he,
and all these women...

206
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,473
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him!

207
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,336
But it just bothers me, all right?

208
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,140
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

209
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,943
I got a great partner to pick
up girls with. Finally!

210
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,082
I'm still right here.

211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,325
Will you at least talk to him...

212
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,928
...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

213
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,161
What?

214
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,801
I just don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

215
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,199
And I will get over it.

216
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,170
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.

217
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,106
I get crushes like this all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

218
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,141
I know. Monica told me.

219
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,944
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

220
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,983
Yeah, sure.

221
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,125
Can you people not see me?

222
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,597
Will you talk to him?

223
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,464
- I don't know, Rach.
- I'll give you 10 free Ralph Lauren shirts.

224
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:07,965
One.

225
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,742
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

226
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,915
You wanted to talk to me?

227
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,345
I don't know.
You got something for me?

228
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,111
Yeah, this is from Rachel.

229
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,920
Ten. Okay.

230
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,322
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

231
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,159
- Really?
- Yeah, for you.

232
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,503
Hey, how much would it cost
to get a big fan in here?

233
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,707
- Hey, there you are.
- There I am.

234
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,247
- You okay?
- Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.

235
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,180
So he gave me an antihistamine.

236
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:57,889
What?

237
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,556
I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

238
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,192
Brooklyn is far.

239
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,490
What were you thinking?

240
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,223
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

241
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,204
Okay, see. Look down.

242
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,167
Look down.

243
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,368
Look down.

244
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,576
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

245
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,387
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,425
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

247
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,557
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

248
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,291
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

249
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,060
...before she painted that room.

250
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:52,101
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

251
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,445
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

252
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,875
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.

253
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,749
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

254
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,750
...but maybe that's just because
I am not emotionally unavailable.

255
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,352
You think he's
emotionally unavailable?

256
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,561
I think he can be.

257
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,588
Maybe he wouldn't be...

258
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,128
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

259
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,563
Excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

260
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,762
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve, 1997.

261
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,805
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

262
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,740
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

263
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,143
What more do you want?

264
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,816
We want the last six years back!

265
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,750
So do we! So do we!

266
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,352
I'm sorry you had to see that.

267
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,830
- Morning, Rachel.
- Hi.

268
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,161
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?

269
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,062
- Went out with Joey.
- Yeah?

270
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,774
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

271
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,944
No, we had a really good talk.

272
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,744
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

273
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,781
Wow, I did not see that coming.

274
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,183
It's just not really who I am.

275
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,256
I've always been happier when...
Why am I telling you this?

276
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,892
- You don't care about this stuff.
- Yes, I do.

277
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,328
You were saying,
"I'm happier when I..."

278
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,000
When I'm in a relationship.

279
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,395
- I love having a girlfriend.
- Really?

280
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,695
Someone I can spoil, you know.

281
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,837
Spoil?

282
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,306
Let me ask you something.

283
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,311
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

284
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,779
I'm starting to.

285
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,617
If that person's in your life,
should you do something about it?

286
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,380
Yes. Hell, yes.

287
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,788
All right, then, it's settled.

288
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,120
- I'm getting back together with my ex.
- I would love to!

289
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,762
What?

290
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,468
Hello?

291
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,434
This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.

292
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,167
Yeah.

293
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,076
Yeah.

294
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,021
My God!

295
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,024
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

296
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,058
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

297
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,597
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

298
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,464
...if someone else knew where
everything was.

299
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,303
Oh, he knows.

300
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,974
For the most part.

301
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,613
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

302
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,606
We kind of need to talk.

303
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,943
- Both of you, together?
- What's up?

304
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,188
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

305
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,051
...and we got to reminiscing.

306
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,783
We talked most of the night...

307
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,326
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

308
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,432
...is because there are still
feelings there.

309
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,063
So...

310
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,130
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

311
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,471
We're gonna try again.

312
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,580
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

313
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,874
I'm gonna work on that.

314
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,278
Right, because you're so
capable of change.

315
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,779
You know, he hums when he pees.

316
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,786
- I do know.
- Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

317
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,694
We're so sorry.

318
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,199
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

319
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,429
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

320
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,632
Yeah, we're gonna go.

321
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,238
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,610
Pheebs, you were right about her.

323
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,419
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

324
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,648
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

325
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,930
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

326
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,899
We're better off without them.

327
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,731
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

328
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,069
- Divorced men's club.
- Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

329
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,211
You know, Pheebs, we don't talk
that much anymore.

330
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,647
Yeah.

331
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,645
Hey, guys, check it out.

332
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,256
- My mom sent me the paper.
- Let's see it.

333
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:41,093
- Oh, yeah, that looks good.
