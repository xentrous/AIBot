00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,664
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

2
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,843
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:15,844
for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,484
Sure, neighbor! Come on in!

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,877
Is Janine around?

6
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,553
She's at dance class.

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,050
Can I check my room?

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,192
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,522
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,565
It's like a guy never lived in here.

11
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:40,035
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,764
It is?

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,769
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

14
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,844
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,550
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

16
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,416
This is a "guy's" place.

17
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,752
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:09,127
And your head's gonna be under a big,
brown, drying, big, drying.. It's not good.

19
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,938
-You're right. I'll talk to her.
-Talk to her. Be a man!

20
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,970
-I'm a man.
-Defend yourself!

21
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,636
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

22
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,369
Be right there, sweetums.

23
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,506
Totally different situation.

24
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,977
The One With Ross' Teeth

25
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,546
Hey, guys.

26
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,659
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.

27
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,557
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

28
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,165
Is this Hillary, your
hot assistant chef, Hillary?

29
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,761
The one that stares at me
when I come in?

30
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,903
The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,340
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

32
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,812
Why don't you set us up?

33
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,952
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?

34
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,079
Come on, I'm serious.

35
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,319
Okay, I'll do it, but as long as
you promise you won't marry her.

36
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,989
Fine, I..
What if she's the one?

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,464
Man, you have a problem.

38
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,328
Rachel?

39
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,443
I'm making up flyers to try
to get new massage clients.

40
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,239
Can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copier?

41
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,884
Sure, but they might think it's weird
since I don't work there anymore.

42
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,778
Oh, my God! What happened?

43
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,953
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

44
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,589
Well, that's great! Congratulations!

45
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,559
A year ago.

46
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,160
You've lasted all year! Good for you.

47
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,470
You could still use the copier
where I actually work.

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,436
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

49
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,907
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.

50
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,479
-I don't think my boss likes me.
-I don't think mine likes me.

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,582
Maybe it's a universal thing.

52
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,483
Maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

53
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,150
Let's head off to work.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,461
-Thank you.
-Sure.

55
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,465
You will not believe this.

56
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,605
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

57
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,798
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

58
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,135
A little. He seems really nice.

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,370
-Good kisser.
-What?

60
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,314
What?

61
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,272
-You kissed him?
-Totally.

62
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,948
Phoebe, are you serious?

63
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,681
He came in and introduced himself.

64
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,154
The next thing I know,
we're making out!

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,394
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

66
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,687
Phoebe.

67
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,391
I'm supposed to ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

68
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,300
No, yeah, I should.

69
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,382
Hey, Joey.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,486
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

71
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,489
Do you know this kid?
Is it a relative?

72
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,594
No. I just thought it was cute.

73
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,263
That's what I was afraid of. Okay...

74
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,066
I really want you to feel
at home here, but...

75
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,204
some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

76
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,362
Like what?

77
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,101
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

78
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,068
We can't have that.

79
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,076
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

80
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:21,583
I don't know this baby. I don't know
if she's a famous artist or not.

81
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:28,257
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

82
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,725
I'm sorry. I wanted to make
the place a little nicer.

83
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,523
But it's too much stuff.

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,066
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

85
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,230
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

86
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,764
I just thought..

87
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,536
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

88
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,702
But come on.

89
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,383
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

90
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,146
It's a curling iron.

91
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,454
Well, that's okay then.

92
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,130
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

93
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:10,393
and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

94
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,464
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

95
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,610
-It's clean.
-It feels different.

96
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,176
It's dry.

97
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,440
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

98
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,851
Also what is with
these chips you bought?

99
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,852
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

100
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

101
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,304
Kim, hi.

102
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:05,216
I handed in that marketing report, and
I never got to hear what you thought.

103
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,614
I didn't read it.

104
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,130
The spring line's really gonna be
great this year, huh?

105
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,135
I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

106
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,869
Tell me everything.

107
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,846
Hey, guys.

108
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,884
What's up?

109
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,819
You know...

110
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,683
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,285
What happened to your teeth?

112
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,861
I whitened them.

113
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,592
Really?

114
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,467
What do you think?

115
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,231
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

116
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,765
Come on, seriously.

117
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,009
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old...

118
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,910
human teeth?

119
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,451
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

120
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,684
-How much longer?
-A day.

121
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,287
Tonight is your date with Hillary.

122
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,522
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

123
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,930
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

124
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,637
She will be after tonight.

125
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,203
Oh, Rach.
Do you notice anything..?

126
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,903
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

127
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,476
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

128
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,918
but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

129
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,421
-What?
-Oh, my God!

130
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,117
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

131
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,230
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

132
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,957
it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

133
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,898
I am proud of all my friends today.

134
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,899
I can't believe Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

135
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,337
I'm so jealous!

136
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,804
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

137
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,010
Chandler, please. Come on.

138
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,684
Look at him.

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,651
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

140
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,517
Here.

141
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,921
Who's the silver fox?

142
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,589
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

143
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,757
Oh, wait.

144
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,528
"Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

145
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,472
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

146
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,677
-What?
-Ralph doesn't look like that guy.

147
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:46,715
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack..

148
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:51,981
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy!

149
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,147
What?

150
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,995
I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

151
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,495
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!

152
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,226
Why would the copy guy say
he's Ralph Lauren?

153
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,301
To get you to make out with him!

154
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,637
This will make them look less white.

155
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,809
Nope.

156
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,889
Colors that don't work are...

157
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:29,152
blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

158
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,126
Do you wanna try this highlighter again?

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,992
No, I think it poisoned me a little.

160
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,104
The date starts in an hour.
What am I'm gonna do?

161
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:46,644
Maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

162
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,906
Oh, great! So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

163
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,314
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you..

164
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,021
Whoa!

165
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,520
We're not 13 anymore.

166
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,528
This is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

167
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,697
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

168
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,127
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

169
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,666
What?

170
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,663
Half the people.. I mean..
Just try it and see.

171
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,172
I am not putting on makeup.

172
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,871
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

173
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,877
No! Demon! Demon!

174
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:35,052
Our drawers will smell nice, and
we didn't waste these pantyhose.

175
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,223
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

176
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,123
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

177
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,393
We've got to organize
the wrapping paper.

178
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,470
I've really gotten in touch with
my feminine side enough today.

179
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,076
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

180
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,412
This has been a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

181
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,176
I just feel like I need
to be in a "guy" place...

182
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,387
do kind of a "man" thing.

183
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,989
You go over to Joey's and...

184
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,160
drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

185
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,726
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

186
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,596
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

187
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,770
I'm sorry. We do.

188
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,668
I don't know why I said that.

189
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,547
Hey, Chandler.

190
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,049
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

191
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,851
No, thanks, Josephine.

192
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,292
Ross, I was wondering if..

193
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,760
Oh, my God! Where are all the men?

194
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,374
-Hi, Kim.
-Hi, Rachel.

195
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,976
Remember what happened yesterday?
Well, it didn't happen.

196
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,620
You didn't cancel the fabric order?

197
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,056
Okay, two things didn't happen.

198
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,228
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

199
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,920
Well, it turns out that's not true.

200
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,157
It's not true?
That's interesting.

201
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,929
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copier...

202
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,905
yesterday during lunch, and
that keycard belonged to you.

203
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,104
You think I made out with him?

204
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,268
Listen to me...

205
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,449
sleeping with Ralph is not
gonna get you my job.

206
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,915
I don't want your job. I don't.

207
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,451
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

208
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,591
Nobody made out with him.
I didn't use my keycard yesterday.

209
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,295
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

210
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,689
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

211
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,650
Yeah. Nothing happened.

212
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,187
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

213
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,465
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

214
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,000
Soon, I hope to open
my own restaurant.

215
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,337
You're a really great listener.

216
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,010
Most guys I go out with,
they talk and talk.

217
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,749
It's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

218
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,915
I've been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

219
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,293
Come on, I want to know.

220
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,592
Okay. I'm from Long Island.

221
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,430
I came to the city for college.

222
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,471
I have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

223
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:15,270
I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.

224
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:24,112
If you sear the stems of the flowers
first in a frying pan...

225
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,156
your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

226
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,192
Joey, that is such a great tip!

227
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,024
Monica, I need to talk
to the girl with the flowers.

228
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,336
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

229
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,302
out of a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

230
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,741
I love birds.

231
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,644
What is the matter with you?

232
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,143
-What?
-You're arranging flowers!

233
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,811
You got dead flowers!

234
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,990
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers!

235
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,052
This is not Joey!

236
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,355
Look, I am still Joey, okay?

237
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,498
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.

238
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,229
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

239
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,173
You're turning into a woman.

240
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,232
No, I'm not.

241
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,944
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

242
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,613
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

243
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,915
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

244
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,082
Oh, my God!

245
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,121
I'm a woman!

246
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,766
So now she thinks that I made out
with him to get her job.

247
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,529
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.

248
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:51,869
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

249
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,707
What if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

250
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,715
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

251
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,648
Did she ever think of that?

252
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,825
You were with Kenny today.

253
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,892
Just for a second.

254
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,929
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?

255
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,499
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.

256
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:24,168
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

257
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,603
Sleep with Kenny.

258
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,779
-That wouldn't help me.
-Oh, yes, it would.

259
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,082
I've had a really good time tonight.

260
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,953
I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

261
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,662
Me neither.

262
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,265
I've had a really
good time too, you know.

263
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,997
Are you gonna eat that bread?

264
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,971
I just like the smell.

265
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,205
You make me laugh.

266
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,778
Would you like to move to the couch?

267
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,353
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

268
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,187
How about all the way?

269
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,858
Okay.

270
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,836
Wow, cool poster.

271
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,569
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

272
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,409
So...

273
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,408
where were we?

274
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,918
Are those your teeth?

275
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,594
You can see them, huh?

276
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,424
Yes. They're insanely white.

277
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,000
I did that for you.

278
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,905
What's the matter with you?

279
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,902
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999!

280
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,686
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

281
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,621
Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

282
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,054
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

283
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,760
Okay, look.

284
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,261
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

285
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:33,233
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

286
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,564
Oh, really?

287
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,203
Yeah, he dumped me.

288
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,872
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

289
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,242
Even though you're a very, very...

290
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,816
very beautiful woman...

291
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,621
I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

292
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,121
But he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

293
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,286
especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

294
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,294
in the Ralph Lauren machine."

295
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,168
You expect me to believe..

296
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,235
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

297
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,688
Oh, my God.

298
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:35,093
He gave you the coldest look I've
ever seen. It's like he hates you!

299
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,824
Then it is true!

300
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,664
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

301
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,670
Oh, honey, come here.

302
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,777
Oh, it'll be okay.

303
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,442
We've all been there.

304
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,148
You and Ralph?

305
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,649
Kenny the copy boy.

306
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,333
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter? You upset?

307
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,074
Would you like me to get
a pint of ice cream and two spoons?

308
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:24,045
No, no, no ice cream. Look...

309
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,514
We gotta get rid of all
this girlie stuff in here.

310
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,619
I gotta be a man!

311
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,881
The living room has to
remain a guy place, okay?

312
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,887
That's the way it has to be.

313
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,721
I'll just put it all in my room.

314
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,590
Good. Great.

315
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,333
Thanks for being so understanding.

316
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,263
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

317
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,005
But you could put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

318
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,039
I mean, if you want to.

319
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,335
Okay.

320
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,276
And maybe the watering can there.

321
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,439
Sure.

322
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,347
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

323
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,785
Joey, do you want me to put
it all in your room?

324
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,186
Okay.
