1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,730
-Thanks for the tasty dinner.
-You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,973
What are you guys looking at?

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,542
Ross and the most beautiful girl
in the world.

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,742
Yeah, come to Papa!

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,584
I know!

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,680
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,257
...but did you see the ass on her?

8
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,724
What did you...?
When did you...?

9
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,897
How did you...?
How did you get a girl like that?

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,400
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

11
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,937
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

12
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,303
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

13
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,141
But that's, like, the easiest era.

14
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,681
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured...

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,378
But I made her dinner.

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,090
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

17
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:06,497
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,065
Fine by me.
Hope she wins.

19
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,636
Hey, we should have
a contest. Yeah.

20
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,174
See who can bring home
the most beautiful woman.

21
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,206
That's a good idea, Joe.
We could call it life.

22
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,273
The One with the Dirty Girl

23
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,958
You have any wrapping paper?

24
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,061
Is it for my birthday present?

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,768
It was your birthday months ago.

26
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:21,102
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

27
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,001
I have a call in about that.

28
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,414
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

29
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,109
The Velveteen Rabbit!

30
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,049
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real...

31
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,657
Don't touch it because
your fingers have destructive oils.

32
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,796
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

33
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,233
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

34
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,063
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

35
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:56,641
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

36
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,500
Honey, that's so sweet.

37
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:03,407
What a great way to say, "I secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

38
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,107
It doesn't say that.

39
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,775
Does it?

40
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,687
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

41
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,919
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

42
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,830
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

43
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,299
It's got to be better than that book.

44
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,094
Like a crossbow!

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,032
Once again, I am sorry.

46
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,032
Thank you. Bye.

47
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,074
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

48
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,282
Oh, my God!
What happened?

49
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,378
Sixty guests.

50
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,056
Why'd you have to turn it down?

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,558
I don't have
the money or equipment...

52
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,254
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

53
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,730
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

54
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,237
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!

55
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,497
Moni-ca.

56
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,511
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

57
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,341
-Do you want to be a caterer?
-I don't know.

58
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,517
There you go!
That's the spirit!

59
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:18,089
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

60
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,760
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

61
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:26,590
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

62
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,428
-Neither have you.
-Yes, but I'm doing this.

63
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,164
That would be great! Thank you.

64
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,778
-Can I borrow your apartment keys?
-Why?

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,811
You can pee here.

66
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,116
Yes, I can, of course.

67
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,286
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

68
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,824
What are you getting
for her birthday?

69
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:06,003
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

70
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,935
You have to get her
something really nice.

71
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,271
-I know!
-And not one of your coupons...

72
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,241
...for an hour of "Joey Love."

73
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,322
-A crossword! Can I help?
-No.

74
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,684
Last week I got all
but three answers...

75
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,486
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

76
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,784
Fine.

77
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,794
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

78
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,892
How'd it go?

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,162
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

80
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,974
Everyone loved the food.

81
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,677
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

82
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,073
The dead guy from today's best friend.

83
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,211
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

84
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,386
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

85
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,317
Thanks. Check out
my new catering stuff.

86
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,858
Look!
I'm an omelet station!

87
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,056
Omelet? Made to order?

88
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,587
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

89
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,658
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

90
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,395
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

91
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,569
I used it to buy all this stuff.

92
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,008
Aborigine.

93
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,616
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

94
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,256
Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,128
Aborigine.
Oh, no, I tried that already.

96
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,177
Would you like to come in?

97
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,713
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?

98
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,048
According to recent findings.

99
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,730
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

100
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,131
Mitzi is...?

101
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,133
My hamster.

102
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,304
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

103
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,370
Have a seat.

104
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,976
Where?

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,511
Oh, hey. Do you...

106
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,722
Do you have any
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

107
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,519
Well, I do.

108
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,987
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

109
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,996
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...

110
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,697
-I'd rather not.
-Oh, yeah? Why not?

111
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,505
Don't take this the wrong way...

112
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,178
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

113
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,446
-Is everything in the car?
-Did you settle the bill?

114
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,187
I hate this part.

115
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,451
Look what we almost left!

116
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,129
That's not mine.

117
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,265
Look what we almost took!

118
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,235
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?

119
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,370
Well, we're all cleaned up.

120
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,978
Good. Thank you.

121
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,387
And, well, there's
this small matter of the...

122
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,254
-Dear?
-The matter of...

123
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,652
...payment.

124
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,595
Jack used to handle the finances.

125
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,035
-You get it?
-No, but I made a widow cry.

126
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,507
See you in hell.

127
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,416
You know what we should all do?

128
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,747
Go see a musical.

129
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,725
Sure.

130
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,427
You know which one?

131
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,598
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

132
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,164
I mean, that one's gotta be good.

133
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,869
Do you know the name of that one?

134
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,605
I don't know. Grease?

135
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,878
Rent?

136
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,181
Yes! Rent!

137
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,542
So when do you want to go?

138
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,278
What? I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.

139
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,994
Man, it is so hard
to shop for girls.

140
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,055
Yes, it is...

141
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,325
...at Office Max!

142
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,961
What did you get her?

143
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,968
A pen.

144
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:15,414
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.

145
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,345
-You can't give her that.
-Why not?

146
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,744
She's not 11!

147
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,183
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

148
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,696
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

149
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,491
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

150
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,031
Sure it is.

151
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,496
She needs a pen for work.

152
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,332
She's writing. She turns it over.
"It's time for my date with Joey!"

153
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,575
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

154
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,906
She didn't have one.

155
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,351
For three years?

156
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,686
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

157
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,915
I can't shop anymore.

158
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,860
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

159
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,725
Thanks, man.

160
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,061
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

161
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,932
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

162
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,100
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

163
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:26,312
Oh, so it's a card,
but it's also a poem-holder.

164
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,351
-You have to get our money.
-She couldn't stop crying.

165
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,053
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

166
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,691
I know, it's tough.

167
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,129
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

168
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,201
-What?
-Pay the caterer!

169
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,670
I've had a lot of jobs.

170
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,831
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

171
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,772
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

172
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,209
...or "I don't know
any of those songs"...

173
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,442
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

174
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,751
So you think she's faking?

175
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,584
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

176
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,728
She sounded pretty upset to me.

177
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,599
She seems fine now.

178
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,141
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

179
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,975
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

180
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,084
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

181
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,648
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

182
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:45,486
And instead of the end of the day,
it's the end of time...

183
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,995
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

184
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,563
-Here.
-Wow. Thanks.

185
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,973
So what happened?

186
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,506
Nothing.
I had to get out of there.

187
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,075
Next time, you take her
to your place.

188
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,110
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

189
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,583
-What kind of smell?
-I don't know. Soap?

190
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,154
-Listen, you like this girl, right?
-Yeah.

191
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,688
-You want to see her again?
-Yeah.

192
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,655
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

193
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,957
Yeah, okay. You're right.

194
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,101
I mean, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

195
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,671
-It's endearing, really.
-All right!

196
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,875
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

197
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,280
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

198
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,288
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

199
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,448
Any luck?

200
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:53,030
Yeah, I found this great place
called "Invisible Things for Kathy."

201
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,132
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

202
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,995
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

203
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,969
...and you get her
something worse than that...

204
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,540
...like a regular pen.

205
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,575
She's really going
to love this, you know?

206
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,809
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

207
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,384
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

208
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,588
Honey, that's so sweet.

209
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,018
You don't think it's just pathetic?

210
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,089
Oh, "pathetic"!

211
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,259
I've been looking all over for you.

212
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,767
-Where?
-Our place. The hall.

213
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,204
I got something for her.

214
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,450
It's a book.

215
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,545
A book?

216
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,555
Is it a book that's also a safe?

217
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,790
It's a book that's just a book.

218
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,795
It's the Velveteen Rabbit.
It was her favorite as a kid.

219
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,625
So just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

220
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,361
You got it. Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.

221
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,307
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

222
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,776
No, it came out to an even twenty.

223
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,614
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

224
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,434
-You didn't get the money?
-Maybe I can try at intermission?

225
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,570
You know what?
Let's just go.

226
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,167
We're not leaving till we get paid!

227
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,669
I don't know
who she thinks she is.

228
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,347
I talked to the florist.
She didn't get paid either.

229
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:56,113
Or the limo driver, or the priest, and he
can get the dead guy damned for all eternity.

230
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,319
Well, I'm not going back out there.

231
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,222
Fine. Enough is enough!

232
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,162
Hey, widow?

233
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,422
Widow?

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,490
Excuse me? Excuse me!

235
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:16,137
Thanks. Clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

236
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,573
But we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

237
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,678
...because you ate that service.

238
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:26,180
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

239
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,650
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

240
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,323
All right. I'll get my bag.

241
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,622
Good.

242
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,168
I'm going to leave some cards here.

243
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,473
Please think of us
for your next event.

244
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,106
So you want to come inside?

245
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,513
Yes.

246
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,555
Yes, I do.

247
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,032
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

248
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,427
Guess who?

249
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,089
Department of Sanitation?

250
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,392
It's me.

251
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,939
What?

252
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,044
Oh, Cheryl!

253
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,245
-It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
-Oh, my God!

254
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,074
I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

255
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,874
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

256
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,748
It's just a rat.

257
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,785
I did it!

258
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,485
I finished it!
I did it all by myself!

259
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,664
And there's nobody to hug.

260
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,855
Move!

261
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,034
Hey, you guys!

262
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,368
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

263
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,009
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

264
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,374
How did it go?

265
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:15,644
The widow wouldn't pay,
so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

266
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,015
I'm a hard-ass.

267
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,293
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

268
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,293
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

269
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,991
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

270
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,231
We should be partners.

271
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,538
We should be catering partners.

272
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,540
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

273
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,009
I cook and you take care
of the money.

274
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,910
It'll be like
I have a wife in the 50s!

275
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,481
How did she like the gift?

276
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,659
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

277
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,088
Yeah? That's great.

278
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,626
I got to tell you...

279
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,731
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

280
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,993
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

281
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,009
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

282
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,646
You know, Chandler got you
a gift too.

283
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,447
No, he didn't.

284
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,154
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter.

285
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,554
Happy birthday.

286
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,897
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,035
You really didn't have to.

288
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,577
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

289
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,543
No, this is great!

290
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,377
-Thank you, Chandler.
-Oh, yeah.

291
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,119
Want to go to bed?

292
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,185
I'll be in, in a minute.

293
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,890
Don't forget your coupon.

294
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,198
Good night.

295
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,208
Thank you for the gift.

296
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,408
I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

297
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,380
...you don't always
know the exact time.

298
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,049
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

299
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,650
The book?

300
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,451
The Velveteen Rabbit?

301
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,563
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

302
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,992
What do you mean?

303
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,593
When Joey gave it to me he said:

304
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:48,330
"This is because I know you like
rabbits, and I know you like cheese."

305
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,974
Thanks. I love it.

306
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,147
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

307
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,443
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

308
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,486
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

309
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,190
Oh, yeah. He's my

310
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,427
He's my best friend.

311
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,632
-Well...
-Good night.

312
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,110
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

313
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,926
You don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

314
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,428
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

315
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,931
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

316
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,104
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

317
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,533
So would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

318
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,773
I won't be able to sleep.
