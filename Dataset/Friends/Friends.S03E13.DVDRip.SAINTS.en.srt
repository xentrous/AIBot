1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,561
Hi.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,362
Six dollars, please.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,108
Six? I just had it for one night.
It's three.

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,904
Eight o'clock's the cutoff,
and it's 8:02.

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,276
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,914
You have to help me out here
because I only have three.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,623
I can help with that.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,820
Oh, my God. Richard?

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,154
- Hi.
- Hi.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,060
Your lip went bald.

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,461
Thanks.

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,206
You look great!

13
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,575
Right.

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,801
No, you do. You just...

15
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,313
What?

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,674
You got panties stuck to your leg.

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:58,947
That's because I was just grabbing some
things out of the dryer, and static cling.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,789
Or maybe it's because God knew I'd be
running into you and saw an opportunity.

19
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,623
It's good to see you.

20
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,833
It's good to see you too.

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,876
The One Where Monica and
Richard are Just Friends

22
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,478
See that guy?
He's in classics now...

23
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,283
...but as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

24
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:10,088
He'll go up to the counter with Citizen
Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

25
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,134
This is nice. I miss this.

26
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,671
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

27
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,535
We're gonna be here for a while,
so just go back there.

28
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,233
Yeah, we're not judging.

29
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,508
So you want to get
a hamburger or something?

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,753
I don't know if that's a good idea.

31
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,650
Look, just friends.
I won't grope you. I promise.

32
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,388
I think it's too soon.

33
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,561
No, it's not too soon.
I had lunch at 11:00.

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,494
Yeah, baby!

35
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,364
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

36
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,038
No, thanks. I'm 29.

37
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,403
Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

38
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,044
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

39
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,147
- I don't know. It could be really late.
- Come on. Not again!

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,742
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

41
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,888
For every night that you're asleep
before I get home from work...

42
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,217
...I will wake you up in a way that
has proved very popular in the past.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,191
Well, now if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

44
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,923
- Hi.
- Hey.

45
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,535
Look at you.
Since when do you rollerblade?

46
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,601
Since tomorrow.

47
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,170
I met this really cute guy in the park.

48
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,867
And he, like, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

49
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,742
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts of jock stuff.

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,641
And what are you gonna do for him?

51
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,977
- I'm gonna let him.
- Okay.

52
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,175
Cool.

53
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,351
- Good morning.
- Hey.

54
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,717
Somebody got in late last night.

55
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,894
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

56
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,588
When did this happen?

57
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,431
Around 8:02.

58
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,700
We talked for a little while, and then
we went out for an innocent burger.

59
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,430
There's no such thing as
an innocent burger.

60
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,368
- Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

61
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,407
Monica, what are you doing?

62
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,943
She spent the last six months
getting over him...

63
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,642
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

64
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,655
It's not a date, okay?

65
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,551
I'm just gonna teach him how to make a
lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

66
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,820
You might wanna make extra, because
you'll probably be hungry after the sex.

67
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,024
We're not gonna have sex.

68
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,433
Okay, nothing's changed here. He still
doesn't want children, and I still do.

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,608
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

70
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,500
Naked friends.

71
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,206
- Hey.
- Hey.

72
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,851
- Do you have any ice?
- Check the freezer.

73
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,486
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

74
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,981
Are you just getting home
from work? It's late.

75
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,351
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

76
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,187
I got to sit in on a meeting
with reps from Calvin Klein.

77
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:01,127
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie.
She ordered a ton. How was your day?

78
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,866
I discovered I'm able to count all my
teeth using just my tongue.

79
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,006
Why do you have a copy of
The Shining in your freezer?

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,372
I was reading it last night,
and I got scared, so...

81
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,079
But you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

82
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,187
Well, safer.

83
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:29,487
I never start reading The Shining without
making sure we got room in the freezer.

84
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,561
How often do you read it?

85
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,665
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

86
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,330
I read Little Women more than once.

87
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,904
That's a classic. What's so great
about The Shining?

88
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,736
The question should be, Rach, what is
not so great about The Shining?

89
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,743
And the answer would be,
nothing. All right?

90
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,648
This is the scariest book ever. I bet it's
way better than that classic of yours.

91
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,091
We'll just see about that, okay?

92
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:05,092
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

93
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,095
- All right, you got it.
- All right.

94
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,795
Now, Rach, these little women.

95
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,099
How little are they?

96
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,240
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

97
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,174
You know, I love this fabric.

98
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,654
I think I'm gonna have a suit
made out of this.

99
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,594
Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.

100
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,921
- Hey.
- Hi.

101
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,462
You have lipstick right here.

102
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,357
That's okay. It's mine.
We just kissed.

103
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,797
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

104
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,437
Well, I'm from California.

105
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,106
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

106
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,225
I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,291
Anybody want anything?

108
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,688
- I'll have coffee.
- Me too.

109
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,863
Make that three.

110
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,793
Okay, Ross, why don't you come
with me?

111
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,832
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,837
Robert's coming out.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,270
What do you mean?
What? Is he gay?

114
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,578
He's coming out of his shorts.

115
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,721
What?

116
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,621
The man is showing brain.

117
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,332
Are you sure? Hold on.

118
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,529
I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

119
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,204
Coffee. We could write it down.

120
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,737
No, no, that won't be necessary.

121
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,580
- Well?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,846
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Well, I suppose we just...

123
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,890
...try to not look directly at it.

124
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,118
Like an eclipse.

125
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,168
When people compliment me on my
cooking tonight, what do I say?

126
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,136
You say, "Thank you very much."
And then you buy me something pretty.

127
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,966
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

128
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,042
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

129
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,177
This feels very weird.

130
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,282
You touch people's eyeballs,
and this feels weird?

131
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,524
Sure, I touch them, but I spent years
learning not to squish them.

132
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,026
That's my hand.

133
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,773
- Gotta keep squishing.
- The tomatoes are squishing.

134
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,942
You got some on your shirt.

135
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,771
Hold on one second.

136
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,240
Just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

137
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,419
It should do...

138
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,249
...the trick.

139
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,493
What?

140
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,032
You've got some on your pants.

141
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,574
I'll just throw them out.

142
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,739
These little women!

143
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,020
You're liking it?

144
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,678
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

145
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,018
I don't see how he could forgive her.

146
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,256
Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,560
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

148
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,135
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

149
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,174
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

150
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,208
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

151
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,716
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

152
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,492
- Hey.
- Hey.

153
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,490
How'd the basketball go?

154
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:34,689
I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

155
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,326
You mean a 3-pointer?

156
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,037
I get more because I'm dainty.

157
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,099
So is there a phone here
I check my messages?

158
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,207
Yeah, in the back.
Do you want a quarter?

159
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,744
No, thanks. I always carry one
in my sock.

160
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,550
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

161
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,923
Hello!

162
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,963
Hi, I'm Joey. We haven't met.

163
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,035
Good to meet you. Robert.

164
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,068
What?

165
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,141
What? You guys, what is going on?

166
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,976
Do you not like Robert?

167
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,548
Why are you laughing?

168
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,743
Calm down.
There's no reason to get testy.

169
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,061
- You guys! Come on!
- We're sorry.

170
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:43,065
We're sorry. It just seems that Robert
isn't as concealed in the shorts area...

171
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,702
...as one may have hoped.

172
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,266
What do you mean?

173
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,340
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:55,276
Robert, could you pass me
those cookies?

175
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,476
Sure.

176
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,882
- Ball?
- Yeah.

177
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,486
So how'd the lasagna go over?

178
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,191
Really? Good. So you owe me
three pretty things.

179
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,133
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot
about you too.

180
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,703
Well, no. It's hard,
this platonomy thing.

181
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,676
It's a word.

182
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,112
Yeah, I do think it's better this way.

183
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,911
Yeah, we're being smart.

184
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,189
Yes, I'm sure.

185
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,359
You really sure?

186
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,625
I'll call you back.

187
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,973
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

188
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,913
Absolutely. This'll just be
something we do.

189
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,776
Like racquetball.

190
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,013
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

191
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:13,448
So just out of curiosity...

192
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,217
...do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

193
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,457
Just your dad.

194
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,726
Although that's actually racquetball.

195
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,464
You know, I do have a blind date...

196
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,802
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

197
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,580
Do you want me to cancel it?

198
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,549
No!

199
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:45,449
No, because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

200
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,828
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

201
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,863
And besides, it wouldn't be
fair anyway...

202
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,432
...because my mother's trying to
set me up with some lawyer.

203
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,060
So who's this lawyer?

204
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,762
No, she doesn't actually have one,
but she's looking.

205
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,744
Hey.

206
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,708
Hey. Don't sit down!

207
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:12,213
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- Yeah, you bet. And first, here's a gift.

208
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,716
Stretchy pants?

209
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,858
Those are the greatest things
in the world!

210
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,620
If I were you, I'd wear them
every day, every day!

211
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,930
Jeez, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.

212
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,502
But, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

213
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,936
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

214
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,170
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,074
That's all right. I'll figure...

216
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,581
Hey.

217
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,685
- How's it going?
- Good.

218
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,015
Hey, Rach, how you doing
with The Shining?

219
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,757
Danny just went into room 217.

220
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,621
The next part's the best!
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

221
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,230
No! Come on, you're gonna ruin it!

222
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,692
All right, I'll talk in code.

223
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,338
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

224
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,931
Yeah, that's very cool.

225
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,634
All blank and no blank makes
blank a blank-blank.

226
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,341
No, the end! When Jack almost kills
them all with that blank...

227
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,416
...but in the last
second they get away.

228
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,681
Joey, I can't believe
you just did that.

229
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,724
I can't believe she cracked your code.

230
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,126
All right. Okay. Laurie proposes
to Jo, and she says no...

231
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,998
...even though she's still in love with
him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.

232
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,175
Hey, mine was by accident!

233
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,214
All right. The boiler explodes and
destroys the hotel and kills the dad.

234
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,848
Beth dies.

235
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,898
Beth... Beth dies?

236
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,167
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

237
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,768
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

238
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,169
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've ruined...

239
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,811
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

240
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,586
No. She doesn't die.

241
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,651
Then why would you say that?

242
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,686
Because I wanted to hurt you.

243
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,994
There they are.
I dropped my keys.

244
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,169
Got them.

245
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,436
Hi.

246
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,408
Sorry. I'm sorry.

247
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,706
You would not believe my day.

248
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,678
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

249
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:07,118
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

250
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,996
What are you smiling at?

251
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,461
I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

252
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,196
Hello.

253
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,841
I love this friend thing!

254
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,014
Robert's gonna be here any second,
so could one of you just tell him?

255
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,714
Please, right now.

256
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,882
Every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

257
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,662
We can't tell him.

258
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:50,426
You can't go up to a guy you barely
know and talk about his stuff.

259
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,868
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

260
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,777
Why don't you just tell him?
You're going out with him.

261
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:05,848
Way too awkward. No. I haven't
even seen it with permission yet.

262
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,352
So, what do I do?
Just break up with him?

263
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,991
I don't know. I think this is
an unsolvable problem.

264
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,283
It's a curiette mariah.

265
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,929
Captain Kirk's unsolvable problem...

266
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,066
...as part of his training to be
a Star Fleet commander.

267
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,968
Kobayashi Maru.

268
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,929
What's a curiette mariah?

269
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,539
It's the place with the cheap rooms
where we stayed in Israel.

270
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

271
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,337
So you ready for the gym?

272
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,645
They got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

273
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,984
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

274
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,123
What?

275
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,992
Okay, listen, Robert...

276
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,692
- Hey, don't we have to...?
- Yeah, we got...

277
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:04,968
- I think you're really, really great.
- Oh, God. Here we go again.

278
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,680
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

279
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,512
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

280
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,158
I don't know what to say.

281
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:27,198
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

282
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,822
Really? It's just like
everyone else's apartment.

283
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,858
It's got rooms and walls
and ceilings.

284
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,496
I just wanted to see where you live.
Give me the tour.

285
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,098
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

286
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,800
- This is the living room.
- That's nice.

287
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,129
And this is the kitchen.

288
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,604
That's real pretty. Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

289
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,870
The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much
your typical...

290
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,173
...bedroom.

291
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,350
We're still on this side of the door.
But I didn't get to see it.

292
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,351
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.

293
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,252
Thanks for a lovely evening.

294
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,973
So who is she?

295
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,713
That was the blind date
that I told you about.

296
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,044
She called and switched it
from Tuesday.

297
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,251
Did you like her?

298
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:02,722
I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

299
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,559
Well, you seem fine.

300
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,426
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

301
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,399
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

302
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,642
She wants to see your bedroom.

303
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,508
You know what?

304
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,413
What if we're friends...

305
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,190
...who don't see other people?

306
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,795
You mean like exclusive friends?

307
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,293
Why not?

308
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,724
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

309
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,932
Would it be so terrible?

310
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,900
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

311
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:58,707
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

312
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,511
...and vowed to be friends forever.

313
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,757
You know, we're back where we were.

314
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:17,662
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

315
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,699
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

316
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,334
Okay, one thing's changed.

317
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,339
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

318
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,915
You know what?

319
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,250
I gotta walk out of here right now...

320
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,456
...because getting over you is the
hardest thing I have ever had to do.

321
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,487
I don't think I could do it again.

322
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,990
I know I couldn't.

323
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,102
Yeah.

324
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,139
So...

325
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,816
How about one last
game of racquetball?

326
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,382
Watch the thorns!

327
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,994
What?

328
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,926
Beth is really, really sick.

329
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,572
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

330
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,349
- Joey?
- Yeah.

331
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,077
You wanna put the book
in the freezer?
