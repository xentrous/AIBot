1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,232
-Phoebe, could you get that, please?
-Why?

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,706
Just because you're too lazy
to get up off your tushy?

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:16,374
No, it's just that all the people in the world
I would want to talk to are right here.

4
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,819
Sucker.

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,648
Hello?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,791
-Hey, Joey!
-Hey, Phoebe.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,254
I need a favor.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,827
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,293
Sure. Where is it?

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,365
I scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.

11
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,294
So you're 5-6-3-9?

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,165
That's it! Thanks.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,199
-Wanna talk to Chandler?
-Let me talk to him.

14
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,207
He didn't believe in my movie...

15
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,644
...which is a big mistake,
because it is real. Real.

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,520
Tribbiani, get back to work.
Break time's over.

17
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,014
-Who was that?
-My stunt double. Yeah.

18
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,592
He's getting a little too familiar
for my tastes.

19
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,825
I've tried to apologize.

20
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,592
If I can't do it on the phone,
I'll go and do it in person.

21
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,769
I heard that. Can you put him on?

22
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,530
Don't come out here.

23
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:21,078
I support you 100% and I wanna prove
that to you in person.

24
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,544
I got that. I forgive you.
Don't come out here.

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,912
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,954
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,622
Would you mind doing
a picture with us?

28
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,528
-What was that?
-Entertainment Tonight.

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,635
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,406
The One in Vegas

31
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,455
Monica? I'm sorry I'm late.

32
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,001
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?

33
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,830
That's okay.

34
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,234
What the hell took you so long?

35
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,537
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.

36
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,212
-Which Richard?
-The Richard.

37
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,574
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

38
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:08,183
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.

39
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,755
Okay, that actually
makes more sense. How was it?

40
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,758
It was really nice. We talked
and I had lunch with him.

41
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,090
That's weird. I dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.

42
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,233
-Really?
-Again, Richard Simmons.

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,024
Go on.

44
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,760
The strange part was
he was really nice...

45
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,873
...and he looks great,
but I didn't feel anything.

46
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,939
So why can't we tell Chandler?

47
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,706
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.

48
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,975
I can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!

49
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,483
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.

50
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,621
On a totally different bet.

51
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,129
-It's almost our anniversary!
-I know.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,961
One year ago today, I was just
your annoying friend Chandler.

53
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,132
Now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.

54
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:01,762
I got you a gift.

55
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,775
-It's not till tomorrow.
-I know, but you have to open it today.

56
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,619
Okay! There you go!

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,919
It's two tickets to Vegas!

58
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,665
Yeah! For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.

59
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,996
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start
our celebration on the plane.

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,331
We can call it our "Plane-aversary."

61
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,405
Do we have to?

62
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,877
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.

63
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,779
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.

64
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,853
Plus, we get to have
our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!

65
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,486
"Anna-vada-versary!"

66
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,956
I think we should see other people.

67
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,530
We can go, right?

68
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,993
Great idea.

69
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,498
I'm gonna go too!

70
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,800
Phoebe, it's kind of
our anniversary.

71
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,738
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.

72
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,741
Ditch you?
You were pregnant

73
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,538
Great story. I'm going.

74
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,851
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

75
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,350
Including me!

76
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,051
Do you wanna go?

77
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,197
I can take a couple days off work.

78
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,835
Of course you can take a couple days
off, because this trip includes me!

79
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,469
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.

80
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,667
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. I waited a year for this.

81
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,437
Art lover.

82
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,479
What'd you say?

83
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,054
I said, art lover.

84
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,182
-Was that supposed to be an insult?
-I don't know, I'm very tired.

85
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,826
-Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
-Sounds great.

86
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,497
I'll call the airlines.

87
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,368
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.

88
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,527
To walk around naked.

89
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,465
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.

90
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,342
Naked alone time.

91
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,809
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean
I wanna walk around naked.

92
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,416
You live alone,
you don't walk around naked.

93
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,554
Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?

94
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:43,629
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?

95
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,530
So far, it's pretty much
the same, Phoebe.

96
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,470
What about after I give you
these candies?

97
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,211
I guess it's a little better now.

98
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,439
Las Vegas, 1.
London, 0.

99
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,947
I'll be back.

100
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,448
Happy Plane-aversary.

101
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,650
I love you.

102
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,795
-Can I give you your present now?
-Okay!

103
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,326
Oh, don't tell me I did this.

104
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,971
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!

105
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,406
How about "I did forget the present,
forgive me" not fake-out?

106
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,413
You can give it to me
when we get back.

107
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,015
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

108
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,152
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

109
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,689
What "Richard thing"?

110
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,792
Oh, no.

111
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,621
What "Richard thing"?

112
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,663
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

113
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,775
I ran into Richard yesterday.

114
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,673
He asked me if I wanted to go
for a bite and I did.

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,474
I didn't tell you
because you'd get mad...

116
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,174
...and I didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.

117
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,276
I'm not mad.

118
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,388
Really?

119
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,786
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite."

120
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,991
No big deal.

121
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,468
Great.

122
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,574
Okay, London, 1.

123
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,410
This is gonna be a real horserace.

124
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,373
Oh, look what happened.

125
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,616
Check me out.

126
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,219
I'm in my kitchen...

127
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,913
...naked.

128
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,284
I'm picking up an orange.

129
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm naked.

130
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,124
I'm lighting the candles.

131
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,133
Naked. And carefully.

132
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,016
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!

133
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,814
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.

134
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,982
Okay, vivid colors,
expressive brush strokes.

135
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,996
Unless she wants me
to be looking at that.

136
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,429
She knows I'm home.

137
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,535
She knows I can see her.

138
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,366
What kind of game is she playing?

139
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,601
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.

140
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,045
Dr. Geller.

141
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,375
Stop it. You're being silly.

142
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,984
Or am I?

143
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,057
Love to love you baby

144
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,129
Love to love you baby

145
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,539
Love to love you baby

146
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,037
Darn it!

147
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,220
May I come in?

148
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,921
Yeah, if you want to.

149
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,863
Do you want me to?

150
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,793
Yeah, sure?

151
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,866
So do I.

152
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,932
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

153
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,907
...I wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.

154
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,810
This is just about tonight.

155
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:29,214
I won't go through with this
if it'll raise the question of "us."

156
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,790
I just want this to be...

157
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,886
...about what it is.

158
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,260
And...

159
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,298
...what is that, Ross?

160
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,131
The physical act of love.

161
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,107
What, are you crazy?

162
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,145
So you weren't trying to entice me
just now with your nakedness?

163
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,518
Oh, God. You saw me?

164
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:09,421
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?

165
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,026
You actually thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

166
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:35,879
Oh, wow. I'm sorry. But, Ross,
you kicked off your shoes.

167
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,788
-Can we just forget this ever happened?
-Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.

168
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,587
-Thank you.
-Yes.

169
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,925
-I guess I'm gonna go pack.
-Okay. Wait, one more thing.

170
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,262
Do we still need to settle
the question of "us"?

171
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,553
Hey, you guys, wait!
You guys.

172
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,059
This place is much better than London.

173
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,959
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.

174
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,702
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner.

175
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,335
You don't eat animals.

176
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,870
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.

177
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,470
I can totally settle down here.

178
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,876
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey! Look!

179
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,143
Look! Hey!

180
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,644
Oh, my God.

181
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,717
Love your condoms, my man.

182
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,563
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.

183
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,790
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

184
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,562
Because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.

185
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,708
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

186
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,410
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.

187
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,575
Who are you talking to?

188
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,407
The director.

189
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,845
Her.

190
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,082
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.

191
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,826
Why? What happened?

192
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,052
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.

193
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,595
I'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.

194
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,528
-I'm so sorry.
-Such a drag.

195
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,998
Sorry I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,366
Apparently there's
a new policy of not sharing.

197
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:39,066
-I knew you weren't okay with that.
-So you're a gladiator!

198
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,445
What's going on?

199
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,547
-Monica had lunch with Richard.
-Dawson?

200
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,620
But that would've been so cool!

201
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,454
Her boyfriend Richard.

202
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,956
It meant nothing. After all this time,
how can you not trust me?

203
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,631
When you go lunching with hunky men
and don't tell me!

204
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,701
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

205
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,260
Thanks.

206
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,970
-There we go.
-Now I love Vegas.

207
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,102
I promise you next time
I absolutely will tell you.

208
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,581
-"Next time"?
-So close.

209
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,615
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.

210
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,486
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.

211
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,661
That's funny, I think I just did.

212
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,426
If you act like this,
I won't be around you.

213
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,291
-Fine.
-Happy anniversary!

214
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,003
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

215
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,297
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.

216
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,598
No, it is not.

217
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,106
Don't look at me.
I just work here.

218
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:56,347
Okay, Ross? I'm a little warm,
so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

219
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,149
Now, I'm just letting you know...

220
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,487
...this is not an invitation
to the physical act of love.

221
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,457
Yep, that's hilarious.

222
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,291
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.

223
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,629
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.

224
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,799
No, not really. You've seen me naked
hundreds of times.

225
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,969
But it was a first for the rest
of my building.

226
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,611
That's true. But I just don't embarrass
that easily.

227
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,945
What? You totally get embarrassed.

228
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,648
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just
a more secure person than you are.

229
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,519
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

230
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,521
Hey, lady!

231
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,162
I don't care how much
you want it, okay?

232
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,367
I am not gonna have sex
with you in the bathroom!

233
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,007
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.

234
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,310
-Really?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

235
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,538
They would scrub the floors.

236
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,341
They'd use it to get the mud
off their shoe.

237
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,385
Sometimes underneath
the horse would get dirty.

238
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,386
So they would stick it right

239
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,318
I can't believe this is how
I'm spending my anniversary.

240
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,895
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.

241
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,597
He was playing blackjack
for an hour and he won $5000.

242
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,530
Can you believe that?

243
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,933
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.

244
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,607
Build up my upper body...

245
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,333
...and hit Richard from behind
with a stick.

246
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,446
Wait! Why don't I just
do what that guy did?

247
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,843
I'll take this $100,
turn it into $5000...

248
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,350
...and I'll turn that into enough
to get my movie going!

249
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,618
Good luck.

250
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,257
I don't need luck.
I've thought this through.

251
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,517
I see.

252
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,736
Thanks.

253
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,363
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.

254
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,942
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.

255
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,873
Big deal.
It's only Chandler.

256
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,410
I am so sorry.

257
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,415
This is crazy.
Such a stupid argument...

258
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,385
I don't wanna see Richard.

259
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,560
So go fix it.

260
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,524
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.

261
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,595
Tell him sorry and you love him.

262
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,896
You're right, Phoebe.

263
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,592
-Thank you.
-Sure.

264
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,103
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

265
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,185
Anybody lose this?

266
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,617
Coming out.
Place your bet.

267
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,181
Dice her out.

268
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,485
Yellow 11. Pay the front line!

269
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,730
So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.

270
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:09,010
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?

271
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,555
What are you?
I am sorry, sir.

272
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,751
I think he just really likes you.

273
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,028
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?

274
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,173
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

275
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:51,220
Do you have any extra pants? My friend
seems to have had a little accident.

276
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,523
-Can I change $100?
-Changing $100.

277
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,896
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.

278
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,101
That's right.

279
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,135
-Thirteen.
-Hit me!

280
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,604
Oh, man!

281
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,578
Wait!

282
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,881
You are not gonna believe this!

283
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,820
I have found my identical hand twin.

284
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,125
What?

285
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,899
My identical hand twin!

286
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,031
What's an identical hand twin?

287
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,694
What does it sound like?

288
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,035
It's a guy with my identical hands.

289
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,872
It was incredible. The dealer's hands
were exactly like mine.

290
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,546
It was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!

291
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,085
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?

292
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,956
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.

293
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,017
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

294
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,821
-How?
-I don't have it all worked out yet.

295
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,695
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!

296
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,329
Again, I must go back to...

297
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,006
...how?

298
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:22,108
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!

299
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,610
How much would you pay
to see this hand...

300
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,547
...twice?

301
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,882
I can't really put a price on that.

302
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,786
Are you un-supporting me again?

303
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,193
I support you 100%.
I just didn't get it right away.

304
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,867
Now I'm caught up.

305
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,900
Identical hand twins.

306
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,638
It's a million-dollar idea!

307
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,332
Right? I know.
Okay. All right.

308
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,500
What's that for?

309
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,139
Well, I gotta document this
before that dealer gets off his break.

310
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,287
I found my identical hand twin!

311
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,685
Oh, you're so lucky!

312
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,162
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?

313
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,296
But she just came up here.

314
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,195
That was Joey.

315
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,966
I wonder where she is?
It's so weird.

316
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,040
She's probably talking to Richard.

317
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,971
Would you stop that?

318
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,877
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?

319
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,947
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.

320
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,981
-Really?
-Yes.

321
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,626
She feels terrible. She really wants
to make up. You've gotta find her.

322
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,291
Good.

323
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,663
I should really start wearing hats.

324
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,846
Welcome to Las Vegas.

325
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,150
-Did you enjoy your flight?
-I did.

326
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,884
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.

327
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,089
-I hope you had a nice flight.
-Oh, it was the best.

328
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,672
I think the check-in is that way.

329
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,449
Kids love me.

330
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,619
Hi, you guys are here!

331
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,285
What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?

332
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,592
Let me guess.
Pancho Villa.

333
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,561
And you're Bob Saget.

334
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,958
Pancho Villa?

335
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,906
What are you talking about, Phoebe?
I don't

336
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,738
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

337
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,039
Hey, you wet my pants!

338
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,711
What kind of party was this?

339
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:50,414
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.

340
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,953
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.

341
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,832
It's the third time she's won
on a machine I was playing.

342
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,766
I bet she's one of those people.

343
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,639
Mole people?

344
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,840
What? No, a lurker.

345
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,733
What's that?

346
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,642
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...

347
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,247
...a lurker waits for you
to give up and then

348
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,473
Kills you?

349
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,346
They swoop in and steal your jackpot.

350
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,586
-How do you know about this?
-My nana used to do it.

351
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,857
That's how she paid for my dance
Karate lessons.

352
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,164
Dance karate?

353
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,928
Yes, it's a deadly...

354
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,002
...but beautiful sport.

355
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,035
-It won't come off.
-What?

356
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,437
It won't come off.

357
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,841
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

358
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,483
I took it off
and then I drew it back on.

359
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,686
Rach, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sure we can get it off, okay?

360
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,291
-Just give me your pen.
-Why? What are you gonna do?

361
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,757
Well, I believe I'm going
to stab you repeatedly.

362
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,330
Not here. There are cameras everywhere.

363
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,623
You made it!

364
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,037
Who's your friend?
He's hot.

365
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,797
Thanks, man.

366
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:22,137
Listen, I talked to Chandler.
And I'm sorry about the movie.

367
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,336
Don't be sorry.

368
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,915
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.

369
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,641
Your what?

370
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,345
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.

371
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:37,420
-Were you looking for this person?
-Not even. This thing is a gold mine.

372
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,857
What?

373
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,558
That won't make you any money.

374
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,098
Well, fine.

375
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,770
None of you will live with me
in my hand-shaped mansion.

376
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,040
Except you.
You can live in the thumb.

377
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,770
All right, baby, come on!

378
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,682
I am on fire!

379
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,249
See you later.

380
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,886
What are you doing?

381
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,749
What's it look like?
Going home.

382
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,184
Why?

383
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:13,020
Wait. Sorry, I was just playing
for one second.

384
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,564
If you don't want me to see
Richard again, I won't.

385
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,428
He means nothing to me.

386
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,969
Oh, come on. I was there.

387
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,471
I know he's the love of your life.

388
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,109
Not anymore.

389
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,005
Really?

390
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,044
Really.

391
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,620
All right?

392
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,656
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.

393
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,928
Okay, this is empty.

394
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,096
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but I hate packing.

395
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,535
Where's the other guy?

396
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,004
Which guy?

397
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,906
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
exactly like this?

398
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,173
I don't know about the hands,
but he went to the restroom.

399
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,515
How you doing?

400
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,322
-Very busy.
-Right. Okay.

401
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,802
Yes, hello. I have a question.

402
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,268
I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.

403
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,168
A beard and a mustache.

404
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,869
Thank you.

405
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,343
No, she didn't think so.

406
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,610
I know. It's like
Anyway...

407
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:49,387
Makeup didn't cover it, we've tried
everything and nothing's worked.

408
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,525
What do we do?

409
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,797
Thank you.

410
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,070
Yeah, it's not coming off.

411
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,872
What? What else did he say?

412
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,341
He said he thought I was funny.

413
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,340
Okay, look.
Let's just go downstairs...

414
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,918
...we'll have some fun
and you will forget all about it.

415
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,215
There's no way I am leaving
looking like this!

416
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,518
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.

417
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,752
Ross, I am a human doodle!

418
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,497
Just because some idiot drew on your
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.

419
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,930
Besides, no one will
even look at you.

420
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:37,005
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.

421
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:43,606
There are tons of freaks here.
No other. No.

422
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,544
Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

423
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,455
There was some staring and pointing.

424
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,623
I need a drink.

425
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,026
They really overcharge you
for that stuff.

426
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,861
But who cares,
because it's all on me.

427
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,037
That is one big drink.

428
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,914
Macadamia nut?

429
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,874
Wow! That's some pricey nut.

430
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,484
Really like those macadamia nuts?

431
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,979
Nope.

432
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,467
Get out of here, you lurker!

433
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,039
Go on, get!

434
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,875
You made up.

435
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,640
I couldn't be mad at him
for too long.

436
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,785
She couldn't live
without the "Chand love."

437
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,012
Get a room.

438
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,327
-We have one.
-Use it.

439
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,164
Bye, Chandler. Bye, Mon.

440
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,202
Phoebe, Phoebe. Please pick up
a house phone.

441
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,244
You have a call from Chandler and Mon.

442
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,914
Hello, Chandler and Mon.
Hello?

443
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,526
You dirty lurker!

444
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:42,229
I'm sorry, you are the same old lady, right?
Yeah. Dirty lurker!

445
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,501
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.

446
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,131
Excuse me?

447
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,332
It's me. Joey.

448
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,738
Do I know you?

449
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,479
Joey?

450
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,249
Yeah, the hand guy.

451
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,854
So, what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?

452
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,253
Nothing.

453
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,322
Look, you and I have been given a gift.

454
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,433
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.

455
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,433
And you know NASA's
gonna want to talk to us.

456
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,905
I have to get back to work.

457
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,001
We can have our own show.

458
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,441
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!

459
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,407
And I wrote a song for us.

460
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,210
This hand is your hand

461
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,755
This hand is my hand

462
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,555
Oh, wait, that's your hand

463
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,929
No, wait, it's my hand

464
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:53,097
-That's okay.
-But you haven't even heard the chorus!

465
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,868
Oh, my God.

466
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,709
I look like my great-aunt Muriel.

467
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,945
All right, you know what?

468
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,272
We don't have to go downstairs.

469
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,110
We can bring Vegas up to us.

470
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,579
All right, come on.

471
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,482
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.

472
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,145
-Thirteen.
-Hit me.

473
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,958
Twenty-three.

474
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,058
Which is what we play to
at this casino!

475
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,292
You win 10 dollars!

476
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,663
-I bet 20.
-Right.

477
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,810
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!

478
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,408
I've never seen a roll like this!

479
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,844
That's right, baby!

480
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,416
What do I want now?

481
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,450
Eight?

482
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,816
-Six.
-Pick a number! That is your only job.

483
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,288
-Eight.
-Thank you.

484
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,363
If you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.

485
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,102
Eight it is.

486
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,339
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

487
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,201
-No.
-Okay, good.

488
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,771
-What do I want now?
-Try a hard eight.

489
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,503
-What?
-Two fours.

490
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,213
Eight!

491
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,176
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.

492
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,617
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.

493
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,826
You get this and we get
the biggest suite in the place.

494
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,028
We get the biggest suite in the place.

495
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,996
The biggest suite in the place!

496
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,362
Come on!

497
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,571
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.

498
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,739
Because I had lunch with Rich

499
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,305
Me neither!

500
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,036
-What now?
-Another hard eight.

501
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,475
Hard eight?
Let's call it easy eight!

502
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,049
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...

503
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,382
...and we get married here tonight.

504
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,888
Shut up!

505
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,732
It just got interesting!

506
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,433
What did you say?

507
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,707
You roll another hard eight,
we get married tonight.

508
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,007
You serious?

509
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,645
Yes. I love you.

510
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,372
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

511
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,008
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

512
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,254
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.

513
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,947
What do you say?

514
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,124
That's a four.

515
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,302
-And where's the other one?
-Under the table.

516
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:44,135
Nobody move!
You look that way, I look this way.

517
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,279
Here it is, here it is.

518
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,482
That could be 4 or 5.

519
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,987
It's your call.

520
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,220
It's a four.

521
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,155
I think so too.

522
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,627
Oh, well, lost again.

523
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,331
That's it. You and me. Outside!

524
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,096
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blond hair!

525
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,505
Be cool.

526
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,443
Okay, your lurking days are over.

527
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,642
What?

528
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,320
Everyone you lurk,
I'll lurk first.

529
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,319
You move on,
I'll be one step ahead of you...

530
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,787
...every single time.

531
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,622
And then I'll be on your ass
every hour of every day...

532
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,455
...till Monday...

533
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,030
...because that's when I go home.

534
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,791
When do you leave?

535
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,470
Also Monday.

536
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,037
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.

537
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,636
Hit me.

538
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,710
Hit me.

539
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,186
We need more cards.

540
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,227
Yeah. And we also need more drinks.
Hold on a second.

541
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,391
Hello, Vegas?

542
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,761
We would like more alcohol.

543
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,938
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.

544
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,075
Oh, I forgot to dial.

545
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,876
That must be our alcohol and beers.

546
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,885
It's Joey! I love Joey!

547
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,719
Oh, I love Joey!

548
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,225
Joey lives with a duck.

549
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,797
Look, I need some help, okay?

550
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,195
Someone has to convince
my hand twin to cooperate.

551
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:32,307
I'll do it. Whatever you need me to do,
I'm your man.

552
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,148
Are you okay?

553
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,754
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

554
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:47,949
Hey, Rach?

555
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,321
How you doing?

556
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,728
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?

557
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,331
Don't let her drink anymore.

558
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,074
Here's that macadamia nut.

559
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,944
No, something else.

560
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,686
So, what do you wanna do now?

561
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,118
I wanna get out of the room.

562
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,021
I really miss downstairs.

563
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:31,325
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way I am leaving this hotel room.

564
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,862
Well, hello!

565
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,836
I'm Ross.

566
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,709
-Good luck to you.
-Sir, you've got a little something...

567
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,679
Hello.

568
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,675
I won!

569
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,678
I won! I finally won!

570
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,647
I won! That was my quarter!

571
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:23,911
Take a hike, toots.

572
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,889
Excuse me, sir.

573
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,754
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.

574
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,257
Is that true, miss?

575
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,321
Sells drugs to kids.

576
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,532
She sells drugs to kids.

577
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,906
It was my quarter.

578
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,335
Was it her quarter?

579
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,737
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

580
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,711
-Okay, lady, you're out of here.
-No, you can't arrest me!

581
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,009
I won't go back to that hellhole!

582
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,244
I'm just taking you outside.

583
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:08,964
I need something old, something new,
something borrowed and something blue.

584
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,365
Here's something blue and new.

585
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,038
You are so efficient.
I love you.

586
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,701
-Let's go.
-No, wait!

587
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,465
We need something old.

588
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,475
I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was twelve.

589
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,814
That'll work.

590
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,951
I don't think so.

591
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,579
Now something borrowed.

592
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,980
Here, just take this.

593
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,452
That's stealing.

594
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,822
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.

595
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,476
Okay. One thing at a time.

596
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:10,457
-Are you gonna play?
-No, I don't really have any money.

597
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,823
Not yet, anyway.

598
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,027
Can't sit here if you don't play.

599
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,546
My name is Regina Falangie.

600
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,050
I'm a businesswoman
in town on business.

601
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,054
Would you like to see my card?

602
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,056
What did I do with my Filofax?

603
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,456
I must've left it
in Conference Room B.

604
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,589
-Fourteen.
-Hit me.

605
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,125
Oh, my God.

606
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:55,636
May I just say that you two gentlemen
have the exact same hands?

607
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,539
They're identical.

608
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,438
I've never seen that
in the business world.

609
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,808
Stop it.

610
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:10,584
Miss Falangie, may I ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?

611
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,312
Please stop it.

612
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,184
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see identical hands...

613
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:21,795
...showcased in some type
of an entertainment venue?

614
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,867
If you leave now, I will chop off
my hand and give it to you!

615
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,635
Didn't I just throw you out?

616
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,006
No, you threw out Phoebe.

617
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,008
I'm Regina Falangie. Falangie.

618
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,377
Come on, lady.

619
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,947
Please take him too.

620
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,812
Me? Oh, come on, man.

621
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,214
Come on, buddy.

622
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,385
Don't let him do this. Come on!

623
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,285
I'm your hand twin!

624
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,726
Hello. One marriage, please.

625
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,399
We want to get married.

626
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,298
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.

627
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,170
All right.

628
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,040
What are you doing?

629
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,013
The "Wedding March."
Does that freak you out?

630
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,085
No, it's the graduation song.

631
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,295
This is it.
We're gonna get married.

632
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,090
You sure you wanna do this?

633
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,002
Hello, Mrs. Ross!

634
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,335
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!

635
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,276
Wait. Okay.
