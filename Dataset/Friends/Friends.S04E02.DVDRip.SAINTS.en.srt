1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,767
Wow. That ripped.

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,472
That ripped real nice!

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,409
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,081
Turn and slide.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,979
You don't turn and slide.

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,915
You throw it out!

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,352
I get tetanus shots
every time I get dressed!

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,655
We're not throwing it out.
I built it with my own hands!

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,929
How about we sell it?

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,099
All right.

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,396
But you'll have to tell them.

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,312
Can we stick you in another cabinet?
They seem all right with it!

13
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,481
The One with the Cat

14
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,260
Hey, why did the chicken
fall out of the tree?

15
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,388
Why?

16
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,536
Because you have
doody on your head.

17
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,940
Yeah, it was funnier
when Ben told it.

18
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,142
Hey, Monica.
It's Chip.

19
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,936
Who's Chip?

20
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,615
It was good running
into you today.

21
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,809
My number is 555-9323.
Give me a call.

22
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,386
"Chip" is Chip Matthews.

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,323
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,462
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

25
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,623
You're so lucky! He's like
the most popular guy in school!

26
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,733
I know!

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,331
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

28
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,918
Oh, my God!
We just had the best conversation!

29
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,121
I was just leaving.

30
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,657
Good.

31
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,694
I've got a report to read.

32
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,629
It's eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

33
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,335
Why? Did you write it?

34
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,833
Look at that!

35
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,047
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

36
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,150
Well, actually...

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,879
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,396
Why don't you give him a call?

39
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,038
-Are you sure you want to hear this?
-I'm sure.

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,416
Chip!
Hi, it's Rachel.

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,351
Rachel Greene.

42
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,046
You left me a message?

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,660
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

44
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,995
Monica Geller?

45
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,370
Oh, that's right!

46
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,841
He called to ask out Monica.

47
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,906
That's got to be embarrassing.

48
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,685
Dumb drunken bitch

49
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,118
Thank you!

50
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,931
Here's a question.

51
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,535
Where'd you get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

52
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,368
First tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in the land.

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,302
It's your ad.

54
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,136
Looks good?

55
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,711
"Stunning entertainment center, fine

56
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,380
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

57
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,550
You're selling
the entertainment center?

58
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,156
Why? I love it.

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,191
-You want it?
-No.

60
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,362
Gepetto?

61
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,192
Five thousand dollars?

62
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,064
Are you insane?

63
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,033
The ad alone cost $300.

64
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,035
I'm changing it
to $50 or your best offer.

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,907
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

66
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,260
What do you do?

67
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,923
I can't believe you don't know.

68
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,857
I actually don't know.

69
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,537
Oh, my God, no!
Shoo, kitty!

70
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,642
There's a kitty
in my guitar case.

71
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,870
Everyone's gonna want one.

72
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,277
Come on, you!

73
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,640
Crazy!

74
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,644
-Oh, my God!
-What?

75
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,619
Nothing.

76
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,189
What's wrong?

77
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:07,326
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

78
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,366
The mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?

79
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,498
That makes the fact that she owns
beach-front property all the more impressive.

80
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,904
No. She was a human lady.

81
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,808
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.
The one that killed herself.

82
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:27,645
Have you been taking your grandmother's
glaucoma medicine again?

83
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,413
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

84
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,058
I'm sure.
First of all, there's the feeling.

85
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,560
And for another,
she went into my guitar case...

86
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,165
...which is lined with orange felt.

87
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:49,230
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

88
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,343
Cats like fish.

89
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,177
You had me with orange felt.

90
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,879
Hi, Mommy!

91
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,558
I haven't seen
this smile in 17 years.

92
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,400
-Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of
-Let it go!

93
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,238
When were you going to tell me
that you're dating Chip?

94
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,000
Now?

95
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,675
Can I go out with him?

96
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,683
No. I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

97
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,320
That thing at the prom?

98
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:41,255
I couldn't find him for hours!
He was having sex with Amy Welsh!

99
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,893
That was in high school.
How can it still bother you?

100
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:50,593
Oh, yeah, you're right, Moni-cow.

101
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,801
Okay, I hear you.

102
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,170
Why do you have
to go out with Chip?

103
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,038
We went to different schools.

104
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,712
We went to the same school.

105
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,441
You went to one where you were popular.

106
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,780
You rode on Chip's motorcycle
and wore his letterman jacket.

107
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,186
I went to one where I wore a band
uniform that was specially made.

108
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,029
They had that specially made?

109
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,558
It was a Home Ec project.

110
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,005
Oh, my God! They said
it was for the mascot.

111
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:34,643
Back then I thought that I'd never
get to go out with a Chip Matthews.

112
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,543
Now he's called me up
and asked me out.

113
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:42,014
The fat girl inside me really
wants to go. I owe her this.

114
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,984
I never let her eat.

115
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,893
-You go out with him.
-Really?

116
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,095
If possible, could you leave him
and have sex with another guy?

117
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,423
I'll try.

118
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,431
Any luck getting rid of
the entertainment center?

119
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,668
There were a couple calls,
but they won't work out.

120
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,075
Joey has a very careful
screening process.

121
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:14,115
Not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

122
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,945
Stop it!

123
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:20,955
She keeps trying to get away.
Just like when she was alive.

124
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,559
How long is your mom
going to be with us?

125
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,390
I'm not sure.

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,400
I guess until she gets used to
the fact that there's...

127
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,934
...a new mom.

128
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,867
Now she's worried
that she'll be replaced.

129
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,768
That's not going to happen, is it?

130
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,706
I have to go make a call.

131
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,645
Why not use this phone?

132
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,379
I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

133
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,318
I just spelled the wrong word.

134
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,525
Anyway, I don't want to do it
in front of someone with a tail.

135
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,598
Hey, you swore you
would never tell.

136
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,666
So am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

137
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,433
Ross, don't start.

138
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,974
You actually believe
there's a woman inside that cat?

139
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,115
I believe it.

140
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,774
No, you don't.

141
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,009
Yes, I do.

142
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,518
No, you

143
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,457
You know what?

144
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,193
You won't suck me into this.

145
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,491
Sure I will.
Because you always have to be right.

146
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,927
I do not always have
Okay, okay.

147
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,603
Jurassic Park could happen.

148
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,182
And you know what? Actually,
I do think Kirk was smarter than Spock.

149
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,692
You were kidding about the
Kirk-Spock-thing, though, right?

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,195
That's pretty nice.

151
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,130
"Pretty nice"?

152
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,400
Pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

153
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,841
We don't have $50.
But would you trade for it?

154
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,205
We got a canoe.

155
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,551
I don't think we need a canoe.

156
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,052
You got to take it.

157
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,026
Just take the entertainment center.

158
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,098
Then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

159
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,370
We're not throwing it away.
I built it.

160
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,765
Good for you!

161
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,408
You won't believe
what I found on a telephone pole.

162
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,843
Look familiar?

163
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,282
Apparently Phoebe's mother
also goes by the name "Julio."

164
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:09,053
Wait a minute. This is not the
same cat. This cat's only this big.

165
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,255
A little girl's looking for this cat.
Know what that means?

166
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,366
Yeah! $200 reward split five ways!

167
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,165
Do we have to tell her?

168
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,604
-Yes, we do.
-But it's made her so happy.

169
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,707
Little girl misses her cat.

170
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,941
Crazy lady thinks
her mother is in a cat.

171
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,085
I have to go have
dinner with my son.

172
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,689
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?

173
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,088
Thank you.

174
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,259
I hate when Ross is right.

175
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,693
He is right, isn't he?

176
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,664
This might be one time
when he's wrong.

177
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,796
-You think?
-Oh, no. He's right.

178
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,411
About your mom.

179
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,150
How's that going?

180
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,328
So great.
We took a nap together today.

181
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,998
Mom fell asleep
on my tummy and purred.

182
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,996
That's so sweet.

183
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,231
I'm gonna get some coffee.

184
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,448
What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

185
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,452
I just feel so...

186
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,852
-All right!
-I'm coming already!

187
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,127
Not yet, not yet, not yet!

188
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,038
-Hello, Chip.
-How you doing?

189
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,608
I'm great!

190
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,872
Got a great job.
I have wonderful friends.

191
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:14,917
Though I'm not seeing anyone now,
I've never felt better about myself.

192
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,781
So, Monica ready yet?

193
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,991
She'll be out in a second.

194
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,493
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?

195
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,793
Amy Welsh?
I haven't seen her since

196
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,073
So, Monica about ready?

197
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,604
-Wow, you look great.
-Thanks.

198
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,237
-Well, you guys have fun.
-Catch you later.

199
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,282
Bye, Chip.

200
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,212
-Are you sure you're okay about this?
-Actually

201
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,582
Okay, great.

202
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,185
This is the unit for you.

203
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,191
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage.

204
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,864
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

205
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,462
-What?
-Yeah, I got in there myself once.

206
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,898
My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.

207
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,803
Then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

208
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,570
It was funny till I felt
like it was a coffin.

209
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,051
No, you can't fit in there.
It's not deep enough.

210
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,418
Oh, yeah?

211
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,080
If I can't...

212
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,116
...I'll knock $5 off the price.

213
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,688
All right, you have
yourself a deal.

214
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,427
See?
I told you.

215
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,734
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

216
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,311
Hey, a nickel!

217
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,308
Here we are.

218
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,611
You still have the Chipper!

219
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,049
The what?

220
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:02,220
That's what we called
your motorcycle in high school.

221
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,122
A motorcycle's a chopper.

222
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,421
And you're Chip.

223
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,097
Never mind.

224
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,795
I think it's cute.

225
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,436
A lipper from Chipper.

226
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,776
Are you still in touch with anyone?

227
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,006
There's Rachel...

228
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,145
...and that's it.
How about you?

229
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,483
I still hang with Simens and Zana.
I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.

230
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,683
I run into Goldie...

231
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,395
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

232
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,859
...J.T., Beardsley.

233
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,422
Is that all?

234
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,864
After high school,
you kind of lose touch.

235
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,003
I ran into Richard Dorfman.

236
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,334
-How is he?
-Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.

237
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,012
Isn't he an architect?

238
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,943
They still wear underwear.

239
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,390
Oh, my God!

240
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,689
What?

241
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,469
Are you all right?

242
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,308
What happened?

243
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,970
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

244
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,947
How were you locked in?
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

245
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,651
This guy came by
to look at the unit...

246
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,446
...and he said
it won't fit a grown man.

247
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,725
So you got in voluntarily?

248
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,589
I was trying to make a sale!

249
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,096
If I ever run into him,
you know what I'll do?

250
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,961
Bend over?

251
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,507
And then Zana just let one rip!

252
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,352
Not that I don't enjoy
talking about high school...

253
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,484
...because I do.

254
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,016
Maybe we can talk
about something else.

255
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,623
I don't know where you work.

256
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,293
-You know where I work.
-I do?

257
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,987
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

258
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,866
Still at the Multiplex?

259
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,433
Like I'd give up that job!

260
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,865
Free popcorn and candy
anytime I want?

261
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,439
I can get you posters.

262
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,938
Thanks, I'm set.

263
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,877
Oh, you know who came
in the other night? Peters.

264
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:40,178
Told me he just went out with
Leslie Maskin. Got to third base.

265
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,248
Do you still live
with your parents?

266
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,586
Yeah, but I can stay out
as late as I want.

267
00:18:55,167 --> 00:19:00,036
You know, with all of our stuff gone,
the unit doesn't seem that big.

268
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,670
Why couldn't he have been a kidnapper.

269
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,839
They really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

270
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,845
Your microwave, the stereo.

271
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,516
Man, he took the five of spades!

272
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,548
No, here it is.

273
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,393
Oh, my God! What happened?

274
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,564
Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed!

275
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,467
So how was your date?

276
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,037
Well, I always wanted to go out
with Chip in high school.

277
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,335
Tonight, I actually went out
with Chip in high school.

278
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,837
Honey, I'm sorry.

279
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,049
Not only did I get
to go out with Chip...

280
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,082
...I got to dump Chip.

281
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,383
-That's so great!
-I know.

282
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,051
What did the insurance company say?

283
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,231
They said, "You don't have insurance.
Stop calling us."

284
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,636
You didn't tell her?

285
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,702
Okay, fine.

286
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,208
Listen...

287
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,409
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

288
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,882
There are flyers all over the place.

289
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm sorry, sweetie.

290
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,488
We can take her
back with you if you want.

291
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,695
But, you know, she chose to find me.

292
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,534
I have to respect her decision, right?

293
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,865
-That's a good call.
-That's right.

294
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,405
Enough is enough.

295
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:50,944
I'm sorry you feel guilty about
spending time with your new mom.

296
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,877
But this isn't your old mom.

297
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,550
This is a cat.

298
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,016
Julio the cat.

299
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,387
Not Mom! Cat.

300
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,029
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

301
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,603
None.

302
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,368
Then you don't know how it feels
when one of them comes back.

303
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,040
I believe this is my mother.

304
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,478
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

305
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,786
Just be a friend, okay?
Be supportive.

306
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,716
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,485
Okay.

308
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,155
I don't know what to say.

309
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,336
You could say...

310
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,835
...you're sorry to her mom.

311
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,376
I think she would like that.

312
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,627
Come here. Here, come here.

313
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,428
Mrs. Buffay?

314
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,893
Sorry about what I said.

315
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,268
It was insensitive of me to say...

316
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,067
...that you were just a cat...

317
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,077
...when, clearly, you are also...

318
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,910
...the reincarnated spirit...

319
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,986
...of my friend's mother.

320
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,416
Thank you.

321
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,483
We both forgive you.

322
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,992
What will you do about
the little girl?

323
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,326
Listen.

324
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,595
Mom, I hope you know
you still mean a lot to me.

325
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,365
You're welcome
to come back anytime.

326
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,006
If she'd come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

327
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,543
Come on.
I'll take you home.

328
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,776
-I'll go with you.
-Me too.

329
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,786
I got an extra futon.

330
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,885
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.

331
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,761
You know...

332
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,698
It's peaceful out here.
