1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,440
Oh, my God, we did it!

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,400
We just got married. Right there!

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,640
Is that your ring?

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,480
We're off to a good start.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,040
-And, you sure you're not pregnant?
-Yeah. I'm sure.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,920
But if you're ready to have kids
we got a room upstairs.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,840
I mean, I'll blow off
this party right now. I'll do it!

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,680
Okay, you guys,
that ceremony was so beautiful.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,400
Was it?! Was it perfect?!
Is it too soon to see the video?!

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,000
Can we just please take a moment?
Our two best friends just got married.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,440
We are so blessed to be able
to share in this incredible joy.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,840
That is so true.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,320
Mon, is it too late to switch
from chicken to steak?

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm so happy for you guys.
And you are both so lucky!

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,120
I mean, you both said the right names

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,080
And nobody was drunk.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
Okay.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,160
And nobody was gay.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,120
And on your first try.

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,120
Great. Great.
Just give me a sec to change film.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,960
I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I'm so excited for you.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,760
-What's going on?
-Monica's pregnant.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,240
Oh, my God. Is that why
you guys had to get married?

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,720
-Guys, I'm not pregnant.
-Oh, slow swimmers?

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
What?! What do you mean?
You're not pregnant?

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,720
-You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
-No.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,320
I'll be right back.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,480
You. Take a lot of pictures.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,360
Why don't we get a shot of Monica
and the bloody soldier.

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,320
About that, Joey, you have
to change before the party.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,600
-I can't. I don't have any other
clothes here. -Find some, please.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,520
Anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France."

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
-Fine!
-And be careful who you hug, okay?

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,680
My father's upstairs in tears
because you got blood on his dress.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,880
Why don't we see the bride and
the groom, and the bridesmaids.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,680
Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys
that you weren't pregnant?

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,400
-Because I'm not.
-We found your tests.

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,200
If you're not pregnant..

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
it's because I am.

40
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,520
Yes, I am with child.

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,320
I didn't want to say anything
because it's your day.

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,160
-I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
-So you told people I was pregnant?

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Does this look like a conversation
I want to remember?

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,440
-Who's the father?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,360
I can't say.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,840
-Why?
-Why not?

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
I can't say because he's famous.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh, my God. Who is it?

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,800
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,120
Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,240
James Brolin is the father of my baby.

53
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,520
As in Barbra Streisand's husband
James Brolin?

54
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,520
What?!

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Well, he never said that to me.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,920
Monica, if you step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,040
How about just the bridesmaids?

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,560
I am the groom.
I was told it was a big deal.

59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,440
-It is.
-Yeah.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,640
Thank you for that.
I can't deal with the stress quite yet.

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Instead you told me
Monica was pregnant?

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,280
You said she was.
I didn't disagree with you.

64
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
Sneaky.

65
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,160
Smile, ladies!

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,400
-By the way, James Brolin?
-I know.

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,320
I could only think of two names:
him and Ed Begley Jr.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,360
-Then I remembered he's gay, so..
-Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
Really?

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Congratulations!

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,920
Look who's married!
And just in time too, I hear.

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,360
What? Ross!

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,200
So if you've got this all under
control, I'm just gonna..

74
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,080
I just wanted you to know
that you have made us happier

75
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,320
You have given us more joy..

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm not pregnant.

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,520
What?

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm not pregnant.

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
Oh, well.

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
But I did still get married today.

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Whatever.

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Thank you very much.

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,480
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you:

84
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,160
Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,640
-Before we go out there, I got a present.
-I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.

86
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,160
-No. I've been taking dancing lessons.
-What?

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,240
For the last six weeks. I wanted this
to be a moment you'd never forget.

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,920
That is so sweet.

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,360
So would you care to join me
in our first dance as husband and wife?

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
Yes.

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,800
-What's the matter?
-It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,600
-Are you gonna be able to do this?
-Not well.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,480
Well, the good news is,
I don't think anyone's looking at us.

94
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,080
So are you ready to talk about it?

95
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
No.

96
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
Now?

97
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,480
No!

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,400
-We'll talk about something else then.
-Thank you.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,440
Who's the father?

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
Honey, I haven't told him yet..

101
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,520
so, until I do, I don't think
I should tell anybody else.

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
That's fine. That's fair.

103
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
-Is it Tag?
-Phoebe!

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.

105
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,920
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?

106
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,920
-Oh, my God, it's Joey!
-Stop it. Okay?

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,680
I am not gonna tell you
until I tell him.

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
At least we know it's a him.

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh, sweet Lord.

110
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm sorry, okay?
I went down to the gift shop.

111
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,440
It was either this or a bathrobe.
What's more important:

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,000
The way I'm dressed,
or being with you today?

113
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,680
Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend
I was listening. Hey! Hey!

114
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
I'm Monica's older brother.

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.

116
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,280
Hello, Mona from her restaurant.

117
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,120
Mona. What a beautiful name.

118
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,920
You think so?
I always kind of hated it.

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,280
Come on! Mona Lisa.

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Mona...

121
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,480
Llegglachen.

122
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
The famous botanist.

123
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
Oh, no, she's..
Well, she's dead now, but..

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,600
Supposedly she was once
quite the hottie of the plant world.

125
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
Really?

126
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,080
-See, I never knew about her.
-Linda Llegglachen..

127
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,280
So, what table are you at?

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Me too.

129
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,440
Good. Now there'll be someone there
who likes my name.

130
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,360
Yes, there will.

131
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,840
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,520
And if it's all right with you,
I'll take your place at table six.

133
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,040
Martin Llegglachen.

134
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,600
That's better. Now, just bend your arms
a little bit. Now look straight ahead.

135
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,040
This time I want you
to really put your ass into it.

136
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,520
Who's slippery now?

137
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Isn't that just the best feeling?
Rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe?

138
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,680
Chandler, darling, look,
my date has finally arrived.

139
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,400
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
Dennis, this is my son, Chandler.

140
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
Dennis is a dear old friend..

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,120
and a fantastic lover.

143
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,040
Are my ears bleeding?

144
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,080
Don't mind Chandler.
He's always been shy.

145
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
Oh, you're right.

146
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,840
Bravo, Dennis.
Thanks for pleasing my mother so.

147
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,600
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.
I was stuck at auditions.

148
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Yes, Dennis is directing
a new Broadway show.

149
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,760
I don't believe we've met.
Joey Tribbiani.

150
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,800
-Dennis Phillips.
-I've admired your work for years.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,840
-You've done some really amazing stuff.
-Thank you.

152
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,480
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get myself a drink.

153
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,080
I'll be back in a moment.

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
Okay. You stop.

155
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,280
Dennis Phillips. That's great.
How did you guys meet?

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,800
-Well, it's a funny story.
-Funny, "ha-ha"? Or funny:

157
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Thank you. If everyone will please
take your seats, dinner will be served.

158
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,560
-I thought you were at table six.
-No. Nine.

159
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,160
See, before, when you showed it to me,
you held it that way..

160
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,760
which was misleading.

161
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,600
Hello.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,040
Will you see if your mom can give
my resume to Dennis Phillips?

163
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,320
Well, they've kind of locked themselves in
one of the men's room stalls right now.

164
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Perhaps when they get out.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,160
If I could get in a Broadway show,
then I would've done it all.

166
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,040
Film, television and theater.

167
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,520
The only thing left would be radio.
But that's just for ugly people.

168
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,080
-What size shoes do you wear?
-Eleven, 11¨ö.

169
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,040
My shoes give me a problem on the
dance floor. Can I borrow your boots?

170
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,160
I don't really even know
where I left those.

171
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,880
-Those aren't 11 ¨ö.
-Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

172
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,200
I have surprisingly small feet. But
the rest of me is good. I'll show you.

173
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,440
Who am I kidding?
I belong in radio.

174
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,240
-Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
-Let's not talk about that right now.

175
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,160
-This is so huge.
-Sure, but as big as your wedding?

176
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,680
Of course not. Nothing is.

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,280
Between me and you,
in this day and age..

178
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,720
how dumb do you have to be
to get pregnant?

179
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,040
Sometimes you can do everything right.
Everyone wears what they're supposed to..

180
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,840
and one of those little guys
just gets through.

181
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,000
-How?
-I don't know. Maybe they have tools.

182
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,520
Well, I talked to her, and she's
definitely gonna have the baby.

183
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,440
She said she's gonna
raise it on her own.

184
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
-Well, maybe that's really brave.
-Maybe.

185
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,280
I just hope she realizes how hard
it's gonna be.

186
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,800
Maybe she hasn't really thought it
through that much.

187
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,120
Well, there's a lot to think about.

188
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,360
How is she gonna handle this financially?
How is she gonna juggle work?

189
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Does she realize she's not gonna have
a date again for the next, like, 18 years?

190
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,040
I don't know.

191
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,360
Are you okay?

192
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.
Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

193
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,320
-Champagne?
-Oh, yes! Thank you very much.

194
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
That's actually how the French drink it.

195
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,880
Well, I just got off the phone
with my lover James Brolin.

196
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
-Oh, really?
-Apparently, he is married to some singer.

197
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,520
But he said he'd leave her for me.
And I said, "James Brolin, are you sure?"

198
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,400
-James Brolin said..
-Rachel's the one who's pregnant?

199
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
What?!

200
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,680
Why bother?

201
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
-How do you feel?
-I don't know how I feel.

202
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,120
This is all happening so fast. I have to make
all these decisions that I don't wanna make.

203
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,640
Someone just take this away from me!

204
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,240
-Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
-What?!

205
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,400
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
I took that test, like, three times.

206
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,120
Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

207
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,320
How many ways are there to do that?

208
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm just saying, don't freak out
until you're 100 percent sure.

209
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
All right, I'll take it again
when I get home.

210
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,040
I can wait until then.

211
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,200
Oh, this is such a good party.
How late does it go till?

212
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,200
-You gotta take it now.
-No, this your wedding.

213
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,560
You're not gonna be able to have fun
until we know. Do it as a present to me.

214
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
Okay, thank you.

215
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,000
-I'll run out and get you one.
-You girls are so great.

216
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,400
-Wait a minute. Who's the father?
-She won't tell us.

217
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,320
Come on! It's my wedding.
That could be my present!

218
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,280
-I just gave you peeing on a stick.
-See, this is why you register.

219
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,160
It was the chair again. Okay?
I'm not doing it!

220
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,400
Dad. Can't you go back to your table?

221
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,880
No. Apparently little Molly Gilbert is
enjoying her grown-up salmon en croute.

222
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Look, I don't..
You know what?

223
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,520
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure.

224
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
Great.

225
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,080
-Dr. Geller.
-I wasn't farting!

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,840
A little game from our table.

227
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,640
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

228
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,080
Maybe later. Right now,
I'm about to dance with this lady.

229
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,120
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

230
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,000
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

231
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,080
Yes, I am.

232
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,160
In fact, let's try my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

233
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,640
-Sure.
-Yeah? Hop on.

234
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,960
Is the pretty lady looking?
Keep dancing.

235
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,520
And the world will never know.

236
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,280
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

237
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,960
I told him how talented you were
and all about Days of our Lives.

238
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,320
You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.

239
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
But you're not just a soap actor.

240
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,160
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

241
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,840
He has no idea
what kind of range I have.

242
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,280
Don't move.

243
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,320
It's like he's running
on tiny little pegs.

244
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Miranda.

245
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
-Melinda.
-All right.

246
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,440
-How cute was that?
-Oh, were you watching?

247
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,480
Can I go next?

248
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,240
Of course you can. Hop on.

249
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,240
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.

250
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,600
-I am so gonna score.
-What?

251
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,920
I like your bow.

252
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,240
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler..

253
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,560
the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

254
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,320
When I first found out they were
getting married, I was a little angry.

255
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,400
I was like, "Why, God? Why?
How can you take them away from me!"

256
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,680
But then I thought back over all our
memories together. Some happy memories.

257
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,600
And there were some sad memories.

258
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,400
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,520
And some scared memories.

260
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,200
And then I realized
I'll always be their friend.

261
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,920
Their friend who can speak
in many dialects..

262
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,560
and has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

263
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,960
To the happy couple.

264
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,400
-Thank you.
-That was very nice, Ashley.

265
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
-Can we do it again?
-No, no.

266
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,520
-So, is it my turn now?
-I'm next.

267
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,640
-That's okay, you can dance with her first.
-Are you sure?

268
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,480
-So, what's your name?
-Gert.

269
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,560
That's pretty.

270
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
What are you doing there, Gert?

271
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,760
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls did it.

272
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,480
Hop on, Gert.

273
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,560
-Why aren't you moving your feet?
-I'm trying.

274
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,240
Faster. You're not going fast enough.

275
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

276
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,920
So did you happen to catch
my toast up there?

277
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,720
-Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
-There was a little something for everyone.

278
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,120
-I know you're casting for this new show.
-I don't think you're right for this project.

279
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,800
You're wrong.

280
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,640
Whatever it is, I can do it. If you
didn't see it up there, just try me.

281
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,800
It's an all Chinese cast.
Can you be Chinese?

282
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,360
-Well, I'm not proud of this, but..
-Oh, my God. Please don't!

283
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,360
-Ready to get back to the dance floor?
-Did it turn into sand?

284
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,720
-Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine.
-No. No, I won't.

285
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,480
Do you know why
I took all those lessons?

286
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,080
I didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen on the dance floor..

287
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
with some clumsy idiot.

288
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,640
Oh, sweetie,
you could never embarrass me.

289
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,200
Okay, you could easily embarrass me.
But it doesn't matter, all right?

290
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
I married you.

291
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,160
No matter what you do,
I'm gonna come home with you, okay?

292
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night
with my husband. Come on.

293
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,280
But I'll tell you, that's the last time I buy
shoes at the Slippery Fun Shoe store.

294
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,000
Just try not to move your feet at all.

295
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,520
There you go.

296
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,840
-I'm gonna have you arrested.
-Why?

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
You stole my moves!

298
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh, Chandler, you're quite the dancer!

299
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,160
-Thanks, Mrs. Geller.
-Oh, come on, you can call me Mom.

300
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,920
Really?

301
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,280
I will.

302
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,840
Sorry, Mom.

303
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
-How much longer?
-30 seconds.

304
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,520
Thirty seconds, okay..

305
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Did I miss it?

306
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,680
I want you to know that
if it's positive, we're gonna..

307
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,600
-I know. I know.
-You do. Okay.

308
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,560
It's time.

309
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,600
Go ahead, Rach.

310
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,720
Wait. You know what? I can't
look at it. Somebody else tell me.

311
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
It's negative.

312
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,120
-What?
-It's negative.

313
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
Well, there you go.

314
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,080
That is.. That's great.
That is really great, great news.

315
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,160
You know, because the whole..

316
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,360
not being ready and, kind of,
the financial aspects, all that..

317
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,760
This is so just the way
that this was supposed to be.

318
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,880
Then, great.

319
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,800
God, this is so stupid.

320
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,360
How can I be upset
over something I never had?

321
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,760
-It's negative?
-No, it's positive.

322
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
-What?
-It's not negative, it's positive.

323
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,880
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I lied before.

324
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,360
-Now you know how you really feel about it.
-That's a risky little game.

325
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,760
Are you really gonna do this?

326
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,480
Yeah.

327
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,520
I'm gonna have a baby.

328
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm gonna have a baby.

329
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,680
I'm gonna have a baby!

330
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,120
-With who?
-No, it's still not the time.

331
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,680

332
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,760

333
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,480
-Thank you.
-That is so sweet!

334
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,160

336
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,360

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm the nice one!

339
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm the one that danced
with the kids all night. I..

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,160
How small are your feet?!
