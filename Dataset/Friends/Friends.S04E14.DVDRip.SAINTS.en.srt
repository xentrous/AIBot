1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,567
So, what is this?

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,672
Googlie Worm.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,196
And this?

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,569
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

5
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,641
It's so funny!

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,581
What's this?

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,718
A hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,914
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,555
It's the classic struggle
between man

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,897
Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,936
You know what'll be great
about the fishing trip?

12
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,834
When my Dad asks, "What are you
doing with your life?"...

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,374
...I can say, "I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston.

14
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,045
What about you?"

15
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,581
Don't stop having fun
just because I'm here.

16
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,288
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

17
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,217
Well, except you.

18
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:14,199
You know what is so sweet? Those birds
have not left his side the whole time.

19
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,070
Yeah, I wish that rooster were dead.

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,240
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.
They broke up only two days ago.

21
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,074
Go fishing next week.

22
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,879
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.

23
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,144
That's only phase one.

24
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,487
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.

25
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,486
Phase two?

26
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,391
Getting drunk
and going to a strip club.

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,493
How does going there
make him better?

28
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,794
There are naked ladies there.

29
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,168
Then to phase three:
seeing yourself with other women.

30
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,909
There are naked ladies there too.

31
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,642
Would you give me one minute, please?

32
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,418
The One with Joey's Dirty Day

33
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,657
These will match the jacket
you picked out last week?

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,761
There we go.

35
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,129
There it is.

36
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,742
You know what I need?
Gloves.

37
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,567
Brown leather dress gloves.

38
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,644
Well, let's see...

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,145
This one is large.

40
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,417
And this one...

41
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,449
Also large?

42
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,349
Two larges coming right up.

43
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,058
Hello.

44
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,923
-Damn you.
-Could I have a moment?

45
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,168
My niece, you see,
is in town from London.

46
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,859
Shropshire, but you know.

47
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,297
She's about your age, I'd say.

48
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,374
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,010
Would you like to keep her
company tonight?

50
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,804
Sure. You got it!

51
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,505
Count me in. Me.
Fledermaus. Great!

52
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,049
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,151
So?

54
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,894
-Gloves?
-Sorry, I'll be right back.

55
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,227
Actually, I got to take off.

56
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,404
I was curious.
Do you have plans tonight?

57
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,532
No, nothing!

58
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,539
I invested in a nightclub.
It opens tonight. Want to come?

59
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,606
That would be great!

60
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,674
You're into hard-core S & M, right?

61
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,445
-Well, I guess.
-I'm kidding.

62
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,924
I'll put you on the VIP list.
Look for me.

63
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,183
Great! You bet.

64
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,022
I'll see you tonight.

65
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,033
-I almost forgot the tickets.
-What?

66
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,362
For you and Emily. Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.

67
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,862
Oh, right.

68
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,407
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.

69
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,779
I can't believe
Kathy did this to me.

70
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,113
I really thought she was the one.

71
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,783
I'll tell you what.

72
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,652
I'm not getting out
of this chair. Ever!

73
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,623
From now on, this chair is the one!

74
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,931
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

75
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,796
Just take the sweats off, okay?

76
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,336
Take them off
and we'll have some fun.

77
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:16,577
Wow, and I can't resist that line.
That's why I never wear sweatpants.

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,819
Did you catch any fish?

79
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,989
You guys have no idea.

80
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,158
-You stink!
-Are you kidding?

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,997
Three days without a shower.
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!

82
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,259
How's he doing?

83
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,992
He hasn't left
that chair in two days.

84
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,262
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

85
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,013
You see? He just needed
his pal to come home.

86
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,250
I got to memorize my lines.

87
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,217
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby!

88
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,927
What's the matter?

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,766
Joshua invited me to this
fancy club opening tonight.

90
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,527
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

91
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:15,299
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

92
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,372
So, what are you going to do?

93
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,206
-I don't know.
-No! Help me!

94
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,409
-I can't. I have to work.
-Phoebe?

95
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,984
I would, but I get
my morning sickness in the evening.

96
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,152
Unless she wants to spend the night
holding my hair back for me.

97
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,387
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.

98
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,256
It's my one chance for him
to see the "fun" Rachel.

99
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,423
The "wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

100
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,263
Are Joey and Chandler back?

101
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,772
Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

102
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,485
So...

103
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,786
No.

104
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,758
Come on!

105
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,428
-She's here.
-Wait, wait.

106
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,600
Ross, please?

107
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,669
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

108
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,830
...so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

109
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,940
That is a toughie.

110
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,775
She's looking down the hall.

111
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,343
She looked right at me.

112
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,113
You can't see people
through that hole, can you?

113
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,151
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.

114
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,886
I thought we had moved on.

115
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,998
I thought we could be happy
for each other.

116
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,361
I mean, was that just me?

117
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,897
All right, I'll do it.

118
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,834
Thank you, thank you.

119
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,303
Emily.
I'm Rachel Greene.

120
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,040
Thank goodness!

121
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,517
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight

122
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,049
Really?

123
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:12,251
I must've missed your call, though
I didn't leave the flat all day.

124
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,582
Well, I

125
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,522
That's not rude.
It's in keeping with the trip...

126
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,392
...where I've been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

127
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,328
...and been strip-searched
at the airport.

128
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:28,530
Apparently, I look like someone who's
got cocaine stuffed up their bum.

129
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,772
I think you look great.

130
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,342
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you.

131
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,286
I'll get her.

132
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,784
Please, hurry.

133
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,222
Don't you just love
the way they talk?

134
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,196
-What?
-The baby kicked!

135
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,739
Oh, my God.

136
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,901
No, wait. The elastic
in my underwear busted.

137
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,476
Oh, my God! I overslept!

138
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,049
I was supposed to be
on the set half an hour ago!

139
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,551
You can't go like that!
You stink!

140
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,589
I fell asleep.
Now I don't have time!

141
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,124
Just 10 blocks away.
If I run, I'll make it.

142
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,829
Run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

143
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,293
Slow down!
No, keep moving.

144
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,568
How did it go last night?

145
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,671
Well, I didn't see Joshua.

146
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,738
But I did punch a girl in the face.

147
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,638
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring.

148
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,747
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.
But there was a Rachel Greep.

149
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,579
So did you get to meet her?

150
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,450
There is no Rachel Greep.
But this girl overheard us.

151
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,094
And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep!"
And he let her in.

152
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,627
So you hit her?

153
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,297
No, she was already in.

154
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,434
This big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

155
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,501
...so I clocked her.

156
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,297
All I wanted was a few hours...

157
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,443
...outside of work to see Joshua...

158
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,341
...so he could go ahead and
start falling in love with me.

159
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,709
Pheebs.

160
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,485
Honey, that's your name.

161
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,954
That's short for Phoebe? I thought
that's what we called each other.

162
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,194
-You're wearing pants!
-That's right.

163
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,337
Where are the guys? I'm ready
to get drunk and see strippers.

164
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,831
It's 9:30 a.m.

165
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,031
They got a breakfast buffet.

166
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,535
Let me talk to him!

167
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,342
-Oh, my God!
-Can't I just?

168
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,514
-It's my phone and she's shush
-Please!

169
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,084
What's he saying?

170
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,850
He's with Emily in Vermont.

171
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,886
What? Oh, my God!

172
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,687
Who the hell is Emily?
No.

173
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,330
When we first met her,
she was soaking, her feet were wet...

174
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,093
Who wouldn't be miserable?

175
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,703
I'm telling you, once I
got her into a dry pair of shoes...

176
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,464
...she was a totally different person.

177
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,574
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,505
How'd he end up in Vermont
with that witch?

179
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,843
Maybe she doesn't hit him
all the time.

180
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,978
There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

181
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,089
I got to go! There's a deer
eating fruit from the orchard!

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,391
He had to go. There was a deer
eating fruit from the orchard.

183
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,160
I don't get this.
She was horrible!

184
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,426
I'm going to go stand over there.

185
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,762
Why do you care?

186
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,433
I don't care.

187
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,876
I'm just upset that
I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

188
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,174
You do not just meet someone
and go flitting off to Vermont!

189
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,411
When you first met Barry,
you flitted off to Vail.

190
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,250
Could you, just for once...

191
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,427
...not remember every little thing?

192
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,064
So you know, when's he getting back?

193
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,221
A couple of days.

194
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,125
I knew something
like this would happen.

195
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,859
What are you doing?

196
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,669
You can't go back a phase!

197
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,273
You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

198
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,748
Why don't you do your phase two
strip club thing with us?

199
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,110
We can be guys!

200
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,184
No, you can't.

201
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,051
Let us be guys!
Maybe we want to be guys.

202
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,853
No, you don't. You'd be all
hairy and wouldn't live as long.

203
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,630
Would you just stop being
such a wuss and get those off?

204
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,769
And come with us
and watch naked girls dance!

205
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,371
Okay.

206
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,238
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,080
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm here.

208
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,254
Calm down, we got time.
We're running late.

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,455
All set.

210
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,092
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating licorice.

211
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,801
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with

212
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,739
What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

213
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,171
You.

214
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,913
I could see why you would think that.
But you know who it is?

215
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,107
You?

216
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,914
No, no. It's Heston.

217
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,580
What?

218
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,991
He reeks like he went on a three-day
fishing trip, then ate licorice.

219
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,198
No way. He's the only one
with a shower in his dressing room.

220
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,198
Really? A shower?

221
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,337
Which room might that be?

222
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,539
The one with "Heston" on it.

223
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,809
Interesting.

224
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,458
I got some ones.
You want to put them in her panties?

225
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,859
No, thanks, Mom!

226
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,524
That.

227
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,799
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant.

228
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,873
Maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

229
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,804
It's not my baby.

230
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,314
Very good.

231
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,083
Really good. I enjoyed it.
Very exotic.

232
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:55,085
I just checked our messages
and Joshua didn't call.

233
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,658
You'd think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

234
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,759
You know what makes it worse?

235
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,594
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

236
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,497
Come on, look where you are!

237
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,902
Another round of daiquiris.

238
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,003
Virgin for me.

239
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,509
Don't let me leave without
the name of that carpet guy.

240
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,850
Come on!

241
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,788
You know what?
I'll go home and call Kathy.

242
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,955
If it'll help.

243
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,093
That was a test.
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.

244
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,728
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.

245
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,762
Then I'll be so drunk,
I'll want to call Janice.

246
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,629
You should! How is she?

247
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,838
I think somebody needs
another lap dance.

248
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,255
Who's in there?

249
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,894
How you doing?

250
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,893
Who in the hell are you?

251
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,603
Would you believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas?

252
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,545
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

253
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,776
No, wait. You don't understand.

254
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,608
I'm an actor.

255
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,855
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

256
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,079
And I stink!

257
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,292
You're in this picture?

258
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:39,122
I'm a cop who won't work with you
because you're a loose cannon.

259
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,059
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

260
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,359
But I stink.

261
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,031
Joey, right?

262
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,977
Every actor, one time or another

263
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,912
Every actor thinks he stinks.

264
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,609
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

265
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,288
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.

266
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,479
You don't understand.

267
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,282
Listen to me.

268
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,656
I don't know one actor
worth his salt...

269
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,663
...who, one time in his career,
didn't say, "God, I stink!"

270
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:20,371
I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

271
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,075
The important thing,
and you must remember...

272
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,247
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...

273
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:34,579
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower!

274
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,082
Do you understand me?

275
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,417
-Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
-Wait a minute!

276
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,526
Take your pants.

277
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,029
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

278
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,299
What a business.

279
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,904
We did okay
at the strip club, right?

280
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,737
Great. Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress is quitting...

281
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,004
...to teach the third grade!

282
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,817
-He still hasn't called.
-Who, Josh?

283
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,143
It's Joshua.

284
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,922
-He doesn't like "Josh"?
-No, I don't.

285
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,959
I'm going to put my sweats back on.

286
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,752
You know what?
You were right.

287
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,964
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?

288
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,326
Because we're girls.

289
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,032
-You know what girls are good at?
-Stripping!

290
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,536
No, listening!

291
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,141
Sit.

292
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:37,177
Maybe it would really, really help
if you would just talk.

293
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,351
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

294
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,680
And you know, if you want to cry,
that's okay too.

295
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,489
I'm going to have
to ask you all to leave.

296
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,531
Forget it. We tried,
but phase three is a lost cause.

297
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,331
Those strippers were hot, and I
couldn't picture myself with them.

298
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,438
They really were pretty,
weren't they?

299
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,113
-I liked that fighter pilot one.
-Candy?

300
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,544
She was so spunky!

301
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,951
I think if I were going
to be with a woman...

302
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,182
...it'd be with someone
like Michelle.

303
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,452
She was just so petite.

304
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,295
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

305
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,468
She had the smoothest skin.

306
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:37,471
I stuck that dollar in
her G-string and grazed her thigh

307
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,543
Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!

308
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,141
I am totally picturing you
with all those women!

309
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,584
That's not phase three.

310
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,982
Well, I'm there too!

311
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,254
Are we all together in a group?

312
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,586
Stop it, you're killing me!

313
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,658
I think I moved on to phase four!

314
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,831
-What is that?
-I don't want a relationship ever!

315
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,161
I just want sex
with strippers and my friends!

316
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,438
Come on.

317
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,701
Let me see that smile.

318
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,003
I don't want to.

319
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,540
Please?

320
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,912
I wanted to go to the strip club!

321
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,512
You'll have plenty of chances.

322
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,417
There are thousands of women out there,
just waiting to screw me over.

323
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,684
Yeah, all right.

324
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,324
How was Vermont?

325
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,500
Emily is...

326
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,732
...incredible. There are
no words to describe her.

327
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,203
The whole weekend was like a dream.

328
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,835
And you! Rach!

329
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,369
You were so right.

330
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,604
What?

331
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,115
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

332
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,550
...where we could really
be happy for each other.

333
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,656
I admit, I wasn't quite there.

334
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,829
The thought of you
and that Josh guy

335
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,054
Joshua.

336
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,200
Joshua guy at that club,
dancing, having a good time.

337
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,098
And the thought of it kind of...

338
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,297
You know? But now!

339
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,341
But now, I'm totally there.

340
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,705
I'm finally where you are.

341
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,882
Thank goodness!

342
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,844
And thank you for Emily.

343
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,852
No problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

344
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,716
I'm happy for you.

345
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,982
Happy for you.

346
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,161
Oh, no, happy for you.

347
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,964
All right. Here's what we'll do.

348
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,432
You are going to take off
my clothes.

349
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,929
You two, go get the oils.

350
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,302
And you, just constantly scream...

351
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,943
..."Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

352
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,637
I want to be with her.
I like her.

353
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,884
That's fine.
Go with your instincts!

354
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,450
What am I doing again?

355
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,417
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.

356
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,090
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

357
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,121
That's not Joshua.

358
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,926
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

359
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,229
I'm sorry you can't stay.

360
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,766
The rest of us
have a lot of work to do.

361
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,965
What are you doing?

362
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,103
All right, listen.
I got to wake up.
