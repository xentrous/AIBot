1
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,764
Can I see the comics?

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,271
This is the New York Times.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,445
Okay, may I see the comics?

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,704
I thought you were taking
Ross to the game.

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,179
- We are. He's meeting us here.
- No, Rachel's meeting us here!

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,183
Come on!
They can be in the same room.

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,357
- You should've been there last night.
- What happened now?

8
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,320
Ross was hanging out at our place.

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,656
Rachel comes over to borrow
some moisturizer from Chandler...

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:36,430
How hard is it to say "something"?
Rachel came over to borrow "something."

11
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,173
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,602
Why was he yelling at her?

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,834
He's the one who slept
with someone else.

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,343
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

15
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,378
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

16
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,574
He is so unreasonable! God!

17
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,083
Although, I think I understand
what he means.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,382
Oh, my God!
This is like 60 Minutes.

19
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,149
At first, you're really mad...

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,885
...at that pharmaceutical company
for making the drug.

21
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,996
And then, you just feel bad
for the people...

22
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,861
...because they needed
to make their hair grow.

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,760
You know what this is like?
It's like when my parents got divorced.

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,437
Man, I hope Ross doesn't try
to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,203
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel were
still together. They never broke up.

26
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,714
- We were all hanging out and happy.
- I had the same dream.

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,856
- And nobody slept with the Xerox girl.
- Oh, I had the opposite dream.

28
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,351
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.

29
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,689
It never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

30
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,630
It's never taken you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,562
Let's go! Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

32
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,798
Let me get coffee.

33
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,670
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's so close.

34
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,644
- Closer than here?
- Oh, look! I found coffee!

35
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,248
Okay, let's skedaddle.

36
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,078
Pheebs, I'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

37
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,844
Okay, Your Highness.

38
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:13,930
"Rachel, I'm really sorry."
"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,189
"Yeah, okay."

40
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,097
Did anyone else hear that?

41
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:26,877
The One Without the Ski Trip

42
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,325
- Is he here?
- No.

43
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,795
Here's your moisturizer.

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,996
You guys are gonna love me!
Okay, check it out.

45
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,141
Thursday night, five tickets.

46
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:34,041
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

47
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,341
I said that out loud, right?

48
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,988
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already...

49
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,783
...made plans with Ross.

50
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,493
Well, okay.

51
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,988
Well, there you go.

52
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:55,825
He got this new home-theater dealie,
and he wants us to check it out.

53
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,696
He's really excited about it too.

54
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,465
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

55
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,574
- We're sorry, honey.
- It's okay.

56
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,268
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

57
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,839
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

58
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,053
And heels.

59
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,750
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,292
Come on. If he asked you first,
it's only fair.

61
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,897
- Boy, do I feel bad!
- Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,365
Very bad.

63
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,506
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- Chandler!

64
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,336
- Oh, my God!
- You're smoking again?

65
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,240
Well, actually, yesterday,
I was smoking again.

66
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,938
Today, I'm smoking still.

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,517
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,348
This is just like
my parents' divorce...

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,922
...which is when
I first started smoking.

70
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,958
Weren't you 9?

71
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,355
Yeah.

72
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,827
I'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime...

73
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,600
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

74
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,242
Him? Ross?

75
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,141
No, Hymn 253:
"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."

76
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:22,146
When my parents got divorced, I started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

77
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,188
Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?

78
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:33,423
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

79
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,194
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.

80
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,665
Absolutely.

81
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,738
Chandler! You're smoking?
What are you doing?

82
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,272
Shut up!
You're not my real mom!

83
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,848
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass over here.

84
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,660
Wait, really?
Because mine get me out of tickets.

85
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:08,261
Look, I just wanna say I really
appreciate you spending time with me.

86
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,529
It's been a pretty hard time right now,
so I just wanna say thanks.

87
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,698
Can somebody else hug him?
I have to stay by the window.

88
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,344
Hey, how about this weekend,
we have a laser-disc marathon, okay?

89
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:29,146
And maybe a tournament
on my new dartboard?

90
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,791
What do you think?
Two days of darts! Lt'll be great!

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,018
- It'll be great for next weekend.
- No, this weekend, guys.

92
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,392
It'll be great for next weekend.

93
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,467
I mean, "It'll be great."

94
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,396
What's going on?

95
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,670
We're sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

96
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,083
So, for the whole weekend?

97
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,743
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

98
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,990
That's okay.
If you all have to go away...

99
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,718
...for the first weekend
I'm alone by myself...

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,397
...then I totally, totally understand.

101
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,657
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.
The last time I went skiing...

102
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:21,806
...I was afraid to jump off the chair
lift. I just went round and round.

103
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,375
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

104
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:30,208
- But you know what? I'll stay.
- No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

105
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,350
What, a "pity stay"?

106
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,549
We're gonna have fun!

107
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,882
We can make fudge.

108
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,354
"Pity food"?

109
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,387
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.

110
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,963
Nobody stays.

111
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,862
Well, then, I might as well
offer to stay.

112
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:02,212
- Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
- You think he's still mad at us?

113
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,579
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

114
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,447
What? Mine aren't tinted.

115
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,192
- Chandler!
- What?

116
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,361
What does the sign say?

117
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,125
"Beam me up, Jesus."

118
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,500
The "No smoking" sign.

119
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,931
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

120
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,039
Well, then, I have to go
to the bathroom.

121
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,709
Oh, please!

122
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,674
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

123
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:39,375
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go!

124
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,812
Oh, now I have to go!

125
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,749
Is that all that it takes?

126
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,018
Sometimes just a small breeze...

127
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,925
Here we go.

128
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,697
- Brace yourself!
- What?

129
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,375
- Aren't you gonna go?
- No, thanks.

130
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,314
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

131
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:20,154
They never have any paper in there.
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."

132
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,329
Well, if everybody's going...

133
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,334
- Don't close it! The keys are in there!
- Oh, no, no, no!

134
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,134
- What's going on?
- My lighter's in there!

135
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,413
Damn! The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

136
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,788
Relax. I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

137
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,015
Oh, I do.

138
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,752
No, I took it out of my shirt
when I put it on this morning.

139
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,590
So if your parents hadn't divorced...

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,634
...you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

141
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,172
Look, I just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

142
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,570
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

143
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,677
What?!

144
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,848
Come on!
Who has the biggest boobs?

145
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,479
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

146
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,052
- No!
- It's too expensive!

147
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,191
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

148
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,452
Your call.

149
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,326
Okay. Monica's are the biggest.

150
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,328
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please! Gotta be Rachel.

151
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,531
What? No, mine are deceptively small.

152
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:48,305
I mean, I actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

153
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,506
Well, then, your bra would
still be big.

154
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,914
No, I stuff outside the bra.

155
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,555
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

156
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,920
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

157
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,254
All right, forget it, never mind.

158
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,930
- You can have mine.
- Thank you.

159
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,666
Chandler, what are you doing?
There is a trash can right there.

160
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,069
I thought if I littered, that crying
Indian might come by and save us.

161
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,440
Okay. There.

162
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,605
Wow. Thank you, Phoebe.
That is very generous.

163
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:31,481
Wow. This is nice. Were you planning
on meeting somebody up there?

164
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,922
Okay. Now let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

165
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,691
And there you go!

166
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,003
Chandler.

167
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,264
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part!

168
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,142
Okay.

169
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,449
Oh, no.

170
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,618
- What?
- What? What's going on?

171
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,313
Yeah, this has happened before.

172
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,483
- So you know how to fix it?
- Yep. Put more gas in.

173
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,001
Hi. What are you doing here?

174
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,970
I was wondering,
when you and I split up...

175
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,578
...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A.S. H...

176
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,271
...and half the hostages coming home?

177
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,352
Yeah, but now it's Susan and me in
Mexico and the hostages coming home.

178
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,182
- Where's Ben?
- He's sleeping.

179
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,826
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah, actually.

180
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:47,192
Susan's gonna be here any minute.
It's kind of an anniversary.

181
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,197
I thought you guys
got married in January.

182
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,996
- Different kind of anniversary.
- Oh.

183
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,630
Oh.

184
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,443
So anyway...

185
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:03,479
Candles, champagne.
Yeah, anniversaries are great...

186
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,879
...because love lasts forever,
you know?

187
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,317
Nothing like it in this lifetime.
Money in the bank.

188
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,320
So Rachel and I broke up.

189
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,729
- God, Ross, I am so sorry.
- Yeah.

190
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,127
You know what?
I wanna talk about this so much...

191
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,030
...when we can really get into it.
You free for dinner tomorrow?

192
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,398
- Yeah. I'd love that.
- Me too.

193
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,838
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

194
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,410
- Okay. Yeah. Triple-A can pick us up.
- Good.

195
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,845
- What town are we near?
- Fremont.

196
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:44,488
- Westmont. Westberg?
- Okay. Why are you answering?

197
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:49,326
- Do you know what route we're on?
- We are definitely on Route 27.

198
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,861
Okay. We are at a rest stop
on Route 27.

199
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,260
Okay. There is no Route 27.

200
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,761
- Okay. Either 93 or 76.
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

201
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,906
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.

202
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:06,601
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

203
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,906
And also 93?

204
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,710
Okay. Yeah. No, they don't do that.

205
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,212
Okay. Somebody will come and save us.

206
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:23,225
Who? Have you seen a car in the last
hour and a half? We should call Ross.

207
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,264
- He can get a car to pick us up.
- No! I am not getting in a car with Ross!

208
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,766
We will just have to live here.

209
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,436
- But it's cold.
- I'm not getting in a car with him.

210
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:40,078
- Think of something else.
- Good. Joey and Chandler are back!

211
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,144
- So the "going for help" went well?
- Yeah.

212
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:49,151
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

213
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,085
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

214
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,227
- Then why are you smoking?
- Well, it's very unsettling.

215
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,528
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

216
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,670
I mean, they just took off,
without even looking back.

217
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,899
You know, I don't need them. I've got
you guys now as friends, you and Susan.

218
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,039
Susan will be so pleased.

219
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,715
Seven-one-seven?
Where's 717?

220
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,687
- You have more for Susan, right?
- No, but that's okay.

221
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,860
I'll just put out pickles
or something.

222
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,656
- Ross, thank God!
- Pheebs?

223
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,391
Why are you whispering?

224
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,269
I ate a bug.

225
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:44,601
Hey, Rach! The tampons here are only
a penny. Let's stock up.

226
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:50,039
We ran out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

227
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,881
Now you want a favor?

228
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,052
Yes, please.

229
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,777
I'm sorry your car
broke down, Pheebs...

230
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,152
...but I'm busy with some
real friends right now.

231
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,385
Please call to let me know
you got home safely.

232
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,224
Hang on a second. Take my car.
Go pick up your friends.

233
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,094
No, I won't pick them up.

234
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,634
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.

235
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:18,003
So you can sulk here, then go pick them
up, or save time and sulk in the car.

236
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,010
- Rachel doesn't...
- I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...

237
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:27,584
...and you're innocent. But don't punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you.

238
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,781
Yeah, you're right.

239
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,926
Phoebe, hang on. Ross wants
to tell you something. What?

240
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,490
You slept with someone else?

241
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,565
We were on a break! Okay?

242
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:47,171
We were... We were... Yeah.
Where are you? I'll find you.

243
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:52,274
- You slept with another woman?
- Oh, you're one to talk.

244
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,045
Okay, done.

245
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,881
What's "pleh"?

246
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:07,819
That's "help" spelled backwards so that
the helicopters can read it from the air.

247
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,626
What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

248
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,197
Car! Car!

249
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,435
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!

250
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,108
- Hey!
- Hey!

251
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,268
- What is he doing here?
- He is saving your butt.

252
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,974
Unless I'm stepping on some toes,
in which case I could just mosey on.

253
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,518
I've got plenty of people
to help on the interstate.

254
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,953
- We need your help, please!
- Fine! Fine!

255
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,219
- Hey.
- Hey.

256
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,794
Oh, no! Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

257
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,737
You guys, what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

258
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,874
Just send him back,
and we're gonna go skiing?

259
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,442
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.

260
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,580
You think we should
ask Ross to come along?

261
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,909
What about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

262
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,983
Ask me what?

263
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,587
If it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

264
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,659
- No, I wasn't gonna ask that.
- I wasn't.

265
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,460
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come!

266
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,033
- Excuse me?
- It's horrible!

267
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:29,230
Oh, please? Can't I come
to your special, magical cabin?

268
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,138
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

269
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,678
Hitting me where it hurts!
My ski skills!

270
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,041
- Here we go again.
- I can't handle this.

271
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,743
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

272
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,356
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

273
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,927
- All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.
- All right. Let's go.

274
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,860
- You're welcome.
- I'm sorry.

275
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,661
Were you speaking to me,
or sleeping with someone else?

276
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,735
We were on a break!

277
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,499
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

278
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:08,510
It's valid, and I'm not the only one
who thinks so. Monica agrees with me.

279
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,514
- What?
- I don't know.

280
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:18,255
- You said it last night.
- What I said was that I understood.

281
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,790
- Joey is the one who agreed with you.
- Okay.

282
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,985
Really, Joey?

283
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,330
What?

284
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,093
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

285
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:35,466
- I think it's obvious who's wrong here.
- Obviously not to Joey.

286
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,233
What?

287
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:44,615
- Joey and Monica feel the way I do!
- You and this "innocent puppy" act!

288
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,909
Guess who I am?

289
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,949
All right. You know what?
I can't even...

290
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:57,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

291
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,628
Look what you're doing to Chandler!

292
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,064
Look. We know that this is really,
really hard for you guys.

293
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,298
You know... You don't have
to love each other.

294
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,967
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

295
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,376
But please, find a way
to be around each other.

296
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,744
And not put us in the middle.

297
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:24,446
Yeah. I mean, otherwise, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

298
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,124
You know? Is that what you want?

299
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,986
Can you be civil?

300
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,727
- Yeah.
- I can.

301
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:41,372
Good. Let's get back in the car. It's
freezing, and my chest is unsupported.

302
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:47,140
Wait a second! I mean, what are
we doing? Who's going with who?

303
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,279
Look, you guys should go.

304
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,546
No. You know,
you planned this all out, and...

305
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,654
...I don't wanna ruin it.
So you should just go.

306
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,388
- You drove all the way up here.
- I've got to take the car back anyway.

307
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,227
I'm spending all day tomorrow
with Ben. It's fine, okay?

308
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,097
Just go. No guilt. I promise.

309
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,232
Thank you.

310
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,503
We'll call you when we get back.

311
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,704
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

312
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,042
Or the rodeo!

313
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,386
- That would be great.
- Okay.

314
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:34,117
I was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

315
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,555
I know.

316
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,166
Bye!

317
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,192
- Ross.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

318
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,628
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

319
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,234
Oh, great, because...

320
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,465
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

321
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,472
- That's not where you wanna skimp.
- You're a genius.

322
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:30,046
It came to about $ 112. But what
the hell? Just call it an even 110?

323
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,716
Okay. I'll pay you
tomorrow, Ross. Bye!

324
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:38,652
So they all took off. It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

325
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,085
Yeah, okay. Bye.

326
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,856
So I'm gonna take off, then.
