1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,666
Wow! You look nice.
What's the occasion?

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,569
Monica and I are celebrating
our 10-month anniversary.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,505
Got reservations at Jean-George.

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,069
How'd you get in?

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,338
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,609
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,681
-Hi, Chandler.
-Hey, Caitlin.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,085
Somebody got a haircut.

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,692
I hate it. I look like
an 8-year-old boy.

10
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,592
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

11
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,735
-It's $27 even.
-Okay. Here you go.

12
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,962
Where's the chicken?

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,038
It's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,207
He said that eggs came first.

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,037
-Thanks. I'll see you later.
-Bye.

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,714
What the hell was that?

17
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,921
-What?
-The flirting.

18
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,648
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, let's see, my sister?

19
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,616
I wasn't flirting.

20
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:06,322
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut..."

21
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,564
First of all, the impression?
Uncanny.

22
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:16,265
Second, that wasn't flirting.
That was just casual conversation.

23
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,074
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,508
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you.

25
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,013
I'm good.

26
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,945
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt

27
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,665
I am so proud of Joey.

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,960
-He's gonna be on Law and Order!
-I know.

29
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,501
Don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?

30
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,436
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

31
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,336
Don't get me started on that.

32
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,344
-I was not flirting.
-And on your anniversary. For shame!

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,139
What's going on?

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,546
He was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

35
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,444
I was not. And oh, God!

36
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,391
You were. If anyone
should be hitting on her...

37
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,458
...it's the guy who's single...

38
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,822
...the guy who can do
something about it.

39
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,125
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

40
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,131
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

41
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,738
Ross, we broke up two years ago.
You've been married since then.

42
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,412
I think it's okay
that we see other people.

43
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,084
I was watching her
at the pizza place.

44
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,983
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little

45
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,193
We don't need her measurements.

46
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,530
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,392
She's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

48
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,760
She forgot my vegetarian.

49
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:28,373
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

50
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,909
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

51
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,237
I am so glad you don't eat meat.

52
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,575
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

53
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,153
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

54
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,382
-Big night!
-Yeah, it's so cool.

55
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,788
Joey on Law and Order.
You must be proud.

56
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,693
She doesn't understand
a word of English.

57
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,365
I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

58
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,236
I've done it again.

59
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,231
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

60
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,104
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

61
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,611
Si. Big star.

62
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,944
My big fat Joey star.

63
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,057
Yeah, I weighed, like,
27 pounds when I was born.

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,561
-Happy anniversary!
-Happy anniversary, 10 months.

65
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,268
In the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.

66
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,565
Joey's grandmother's right there.

67
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,334
-The one who speaks English?
-The one who doesn't.

68
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,841
That was some hot love you gave me.

69
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,281
-I'll get ready.
-Wear those earrings I got you.

70
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,145
That's a great idea. I was saving
them for something special.

71
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,582
-You've got to go home.
-But I like it here.

72
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,121
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

73
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,323
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

74
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,964
I need those earrings you borrowed.

75
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,007
Yeah, I'll be right back.

76
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,180
Phoebe, you speak Italian?

77
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,651
I guess so.

78
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,221
-Here you go.
-Thanks. Where's the other one?

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,669
Oh, what, you want both of them?
That's a little greedy, don't you think?

80
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,432
Rachel Karen Greene,
where's the other one?

81
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,633
Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it.

82
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,336
I know it's in the apartment,
but I definitely lost it.

83
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,907
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

84
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,485
-Tell her to wear her own earrings.
-These are her earrings.

85
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,991
You lent me her earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

86
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,691
-Why not?
-Because I lose her stuff!

87
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,503
You see that blind guy?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.

88
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,709
My big scene's coming up.
The big scene coming up.

89
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:28,317
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up,"
would she know the difference?

90
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,953
What are you doing?

91
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,461
Oh, I just can't watch.
It's too scary.

92
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,129
It's a diaper commercial.

93
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,293
Yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities...

94
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,129
-Pizza delivery.
-I'll get it! I will get that!

95
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,009
How does my hair look?

96
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,604
Ross, it hasn't moved since 1996.

97
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,151
One vegetarian pizza.
It's 12.50.

98
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,160
By the way, if it makes
you feel any better...

99
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,489
...I happen to like
8-year-old boys.

100
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,824
What?

101
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,707
Your hair.
Before. Your hair.

102
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,002
You said you thought your hair
looked like an 8-year-old boy's...

103
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,372
...and I'm just saying I like it.

104
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,078
The hair.

105
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,779
Thanks.

106
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,886
You understand, I don't actually
like 8-year-old boys.

107
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,053
All I'm looking for is the money.

108
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,955
Here you go.
Stop bringing us pizzas, you.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,599
I'm gonna try.

110
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,364
You're welcome.

111
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,870
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

112
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:01,045
This is a girl I really like,
and you had to swoop in there!

113
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,236
What?

114
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,214
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

115
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,279
Thank you for that.

116
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,582
I was not flirting.

117
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,759
It's okay. I don't care.
That's fine.

118
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,924
Really?

119
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,429
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.

120
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,733
You flirt with guys all the time?

121
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,502
It doesn't mean anything. Just like
it doesn't mean anything with you.

122
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,141
There's a difference.
You're a lot hotter.

123
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,607
True story.

124
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,747
This actually bothers you?

125
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,474
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.

126
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,344
When you and Ross dated...

127
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,647
...did it bother you
when he flirted with other women?

128
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,190
No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

129
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,829
And thank you for that.

130
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,832
I never had to worry.

131
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,298
He was never good
at the flirting thing.

132
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,308
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.

133
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,671
No, you're right.

134
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,474
We met, you flirted and then bam!
Nine years later, you had me.

135
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,879
All right.

136
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,180
You know what I'll do?
I'll order another pizza.

137
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,517
And when Caitlin gets here...

138
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,623
...I will show you how well I flirt.

139
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,853
I will get her phone number.

140
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,622
And not the one on the menu.

141
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,036
-I found it.
-Thank God! Where was it?

142
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,194
On your dresser.

143
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,636
Okay, that is the one we already have.

144
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,508
Here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

145
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,141
-Wanna bet nobody heard anything?
-No bet.

146
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,578
Anybody home?

147
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,916
-Oh, my God.
-What?

148
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:53,522
Everybody keep smiling. It'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out.

149
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,648
What is it?

150
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,692
They cut me out of the show.

151
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,890
What?

152
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,598
-Are you sure?
-Maybe your scene's coming up.

153
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,995
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

154
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm in it.

155
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,439
This is terrible.
What'll you do?

156
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,941
I don't know. This little
old lady lives for my career.

157
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,479
When they dumped me off
Days of Our Lives, she almost died.

158
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,639
That's not good.

159
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,947
-Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse.
-Oh, my God.

160
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,079
Yeah, she almost died
and got really expensive.

161
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,856
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Everybody smile!

162
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,165
Just tell her what happened.
It's not your fault.

163
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,029
If we keep talking this way,
won't we freak her out soon?

164
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,572
Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

165
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,241
There I am!

166
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,646
Sam Waterston!

167
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,974
No, no. That's me.
That's me!

168
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,377
No. Sam Waterston.

169
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,419
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.

170
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,716
She doesn't know "hello,"
but she knows Capricorn One.

171
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,521
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

172
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,862
But I already gave them back to you.

173
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,025
No, you didn't.

174
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,900
I already didn't gave them back to you.
That's what I said.

175
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,932
Where's that other earring?

176
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,337
It's not here, Phoebe.
It's not here.

177
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,513
I went to Chandler's last night.

178
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,206
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

179
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,411
Chandler has a jewelry box?

180
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,221
We have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to get into that now?

181
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,730
Hey, Phoebe.

182
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,598
How's that...

183
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,200
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you?

184
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,764
You and those vegetables
have a real...

185
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,034
...thing going on, huh?

186
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,611
Why are you being weird?

187
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,540
Do you like it?

188
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,778
No. That'd be,
"Why are you being cute?"

189
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,216
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

190
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,621
I did not get that.

191
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,061
So, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?

192
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,426
Yeah, it's good.

193
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,728
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...

194
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,270
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

195
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,634
Okay, let me get this straight.

196
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,781
It's okay for you to flirt,
but not for me?

197
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,643
I'm glad we cleared that up.

198
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,248
I'm sorry, but some things are
different for men and women.

199
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,251
Teach me about men and women.

200
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,654
I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

201
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,426
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."

202
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,191
But he thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

203
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,365
-No way!
-It's true.

204
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,606
-Well, that's pathetic.
-Again, true.

205
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,769
-This goes for all guys?
-All guys that are awake.

206
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,634
We go to sleep.

207
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,839
All guys from the other end of the
world wake up and act the same way.

208
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,019
It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.

209
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,122
Joey, this is the last commercial.

210
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,258
-You got 10 minutes left.
-I know!

211
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,121
What am I gonna do?

212
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,860
You will not run out
and leave her here.

213
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,396
Yeah, all right.

214
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,575
Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

215
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,842
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

216
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,342
So you're old and small.

217
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,455
-Did you find it?
-The earring, no.

218
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,120
But I found my sunglasses.

219
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,993
I've been looking for these
since last summer.

220
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,163
Those are mine.
You borrowed them from me.

221
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,171
Okay. Calm down.
Here they are.

222
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,675
-What do we do?
-I don't know. I don't know!

223
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,679
We'll just have
to tell Monica, that's all.

224
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,887
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

225
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,847
I could tell her it was all my fault.

226
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,582
Oh, that'd be great.

227
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,056
Mon, could I talk to you?

228
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,923
Yeah. What is it?

229
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,235
I lost one of your earrings.

230
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,428
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

231
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,404
All right, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

232
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,614
I'll replace it. I promise.
I feel so terrible.

233
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,579
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.

234
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,852
Look at you. Come here.

235
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,684
-You feel better?
-Yeah. You're the best.

236
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,952
Okay, wait a minute.

237
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,027
I can't do this.

238
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,598
Listen, honey,
it's not Phoebe's fault.

239
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,526
She lent me the earrings.

240
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,262
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.

241
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,070
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!

242
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,481
First, my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.

243
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,980
And if it's not that,
it's my sunglasses.

244
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,117
Your sunglasses?

245
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,083
Oh, right.

246
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,658
-Pizza.
-Mine, mine, mine!

247
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,556
Okay, here goes.

248
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,992
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

249
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,757
Okay, hold on.

250
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:44,403
If you really like this girl, I don't
think flirting is the right way

251
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,840
You'll see.

252
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,444
What's her name?

253
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,983
Caitlin!

254
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,089
We can't keep eating like this.

255
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,997
It's $12.50.

256
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:21,373
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those wood-burning ovens?

257
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,849
No, actually, I think they're gas.

258
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,278
Gas?

259
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,480
Intense.

260
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,652
If this is how all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

261
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,225
You know that smell gas has?

262
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,038
They put that in.

263
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,203
-What?
-The gas is odorless.

264
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,974
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

265
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,214
Well, okay.

266
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,254
A lot of other gas smells.

267
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,230
Oh, the humanity!

268
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,433
Methane smells...

269
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,006
You know what?
Actually, I really should go.

270
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,179
-But I haven't paid you yet.
-That's okay.

271
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,349
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

272
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,788
Was I talking to her about gas?

273
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,728
More so than anything else.

274
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,901
I found it interesting.

275
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,661
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,968
Don't worry about it.

277
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,303
In nine years, she and I
will be right there!

278
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,584
I'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

279
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,061
What else do they add smell to?

280
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,629
Caitlin! Caitlin!

281
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,669
Hi, I'm Rachel.

282
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,274
The people with all the pizza.

283
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,968
Was there a problem?

284
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,180
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

285
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,440
But, actually, my friend Ross...

286
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,419
...he gets nervous when he's flirting.

287
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,116
Oh, my God!

288
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,417
That was flirting?

289
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,988
I know, I know.

290
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,460
I'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

291
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,099
...where it feels
like you wanna die...

292
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,303
...he's a really good person.

293
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,768
The guy with the gas?

294
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,537
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

295
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,835
...and he's just got a good heart.

296
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,746
You know, actually, I did think that
he was cute and then he started talking.

297
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,150
See, there you go.

298
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,381
-Besides, I think he really likes you.
-Really?

299
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:23,550
Well, we have seven people
and 10 pizzas. What do you think?

300
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,591
I thought Joey was there.

301
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,194
Yeah, no, but just I'm telling you
he's worth a shot.

302
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,670
Well, if he's so great
why don't you go out with him?

303
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,044
Well, you know, at some point...

304
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,207
...you and I may need
to have a longer conversation.

305
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,778
Hey, Ross?

306
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,352
I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

307
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,360
You must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought.

308
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,658
-What?
-I don't get it, but she wanted me...

309
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,132
...to give you her number.

310
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,871
And she just gave you this?

311
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,774
Rach, thanks. But I don't need
you doing me any favors.

312
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,451
I didn't.
She thought you were cute.

313
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,115
Well, that I can believe.

314
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,382
Hey, is the show still on?

315
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,788
Almost over, man.

316
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,461
Hey, Nonnie.

317
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,759
Is that the pope?

318
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,093
Why am I looking?

319
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,998
Oh, here I am!
This is my big scene.

320
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,504
All right, back off!

321
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,274
I got a gun!

322
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,179
I'm not afraid to use it.

323
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,081
That's right, Nonnie.

324
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,785
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

325
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,614
Now, I want a suitcase
filled with $ 100,000

326
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,527
Filled with $ 100,000
in small bills.

327
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,924
And if I don't get
Shoo!

328
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,431
And if I don't get it...

329
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,637
...I'll shoot this duck!

330
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,432
Oh, no!

331
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,966
I'm coming out!

332
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,514
And she's supposed to buy this?

333
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,856
Ground control to Major Tom

334
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,961
Commencing countdown

335
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,893
Engines

336
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,456
On

337
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,207
That's scenes from next week's show.
Next week.

338
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,308
I am definitely gonna watch that.

339
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,382
Do these look the same?

340
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,614
-Definitely.
-Not as each other.

341
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,622
Then, no.

342
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,330
-Hey, you ready?
-Yeah.

343
