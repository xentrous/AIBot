1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,633
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,270
I told you everything I knew
last night.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,202
It's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,005
I cannot believe you would say that!

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,944
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are "making love."

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,714
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

7
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,889
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,381
I don't know.

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,392
God, I just can't imagine Chandler
being romantic.

10
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,724
Is he romantic with her?

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,057
I don't know.

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,500
Are they in love?

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,329
I don't know.

14
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,609
You don't know anything.

15
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:45,902
I know one thing.

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,974
They did it right there.

17
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,180
The One With Chandler's Work Laugh

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,867
Could I have a scone?

19
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,136
-Want to hear some good news?
-Is somebody else gonna give it to us?

20
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,434
Because you certainly don't seem like
you have any.

21
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,204
No, I do.
Someone I know is getting married.

22
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,906
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

23
00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,841
Sorry, man.

24
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,850
-Here's your scone.
-Thanks.

25
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,520
Stupid British snack food!

26
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,822
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,230
You know what might
help you deal with it?

28
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,836
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

29
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,940
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

30
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,278
Nobody's mad about that.

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,208
Exactly!
Because it's in the past.

32
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,216
Anybody going to eat that?

33
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,259
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

34
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,296
We had a lot of liquor
left over from Christmas.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,899
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a real couple. We don't have to hide.

36
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,969
I know. I can do this.

37
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,700
And I can do this.

38
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,241
We can't do that.

39
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,976
Hey, Bing!

40
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,909
Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

41
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,757
I asked myself
that very question, sir.

42
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,914
My boss, Doug.

43
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,753
-This is Monica.
-Hi.

44
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,589
-This is my wife, Kara.
-Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,400
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

46
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,537
Dickem, Stickem & Run.

47
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,407
Let's go drink our body weight.

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,345
What was that?

49
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,674
That noise you made?

50
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,145
Oh, my work laugh.

51
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,874
Your work laugh?

52
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:44,022
If you're going to survive this party,
come up with one too.

53
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,047
All right. Check me out.

54
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,424
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town."

55
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,531
Everybody at work loved you last night.

56
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,942
And they like me more
just because I was with you.

57
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,111
You repaired the damage
from when they met Joey.

58
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,509
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.

59
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,051
Except for that time
at that strip club.

60
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,084
Strip church.

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,025
-I'll go find a racket.
-I thought you had one.

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,360
I used to, but then Joey thought
it'd be fun to go hit rocks...

63
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,193
...at bigger rocks.

64
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,367
Do you have a tennis racket?

65
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,370
I lent it to Joey, and
I've never gotten it back.

66
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,637
Good luck with that.

67
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,408
What's up?

68
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,211
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.

69
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,820
I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

70
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,649
...and spend some time
with my friend Monica.

71
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,420
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

72
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,960
How are you?

73
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,822
What is new with you?

74
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,600
Not much. Work's good.

75
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,968
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.

76
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,502
You know what?

77
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,938
Let's talk about relationships.

78
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,480
What's going on?

79
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,149
Nothing.

80
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,108
You go.

81
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,955
There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

82
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,649
But I don't anymore.

83
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,586
That's juicy.

84
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:35,129
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

85
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,702
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

86
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,496
I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

87
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,937
No!

88
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,507
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

89
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,789
Then what happened?

90
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,860
You'll get your turn.

91
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,834
-Hey, Phoebe. What's going on?
-Nothing.

92
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,466
This is not over.

93
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,630
No, no, no!

94
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,311
I was up all night writing
this nasty letter to Emily.

95
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,379
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in...

96
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,243
Actually, thanks!

97
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,550
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?

98
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,850
Actually, I think I'll skip it.

99
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,216
Really?

100
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,588
I'll read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.

101
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,391
Sure you don't want to?

102
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,689
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

103
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,867
That's okay, Joe.

104
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,695
Let's go, Phoebe.

105
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,884
Game!

106
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,251
I got to tell you, that partner
of yours is a real tiger.

107
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,221
Are you all right?

108
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,900
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

109
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,435
Am I on fire today or what?

110
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,767
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

111
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,408
Okay, easy, Martina.

112
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,708
I think we should let them
win the next game.

113
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,886
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

114
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,280
Let them win one.

115
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,654
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

116
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,963
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

117
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,759
You're not giving them a chance.

118
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,457
They have rackets.

119
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,769
We'll make this the last game.

120
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,975
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

121
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,234
Are you sure you never played pro?

122
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,006
Please let them win.

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,977
I'll take it down to 95%,
but that's the best I can do.

124
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,684
-Missed it!
-I got it!

125
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,518
Nice shot.

126
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,529
I got it!

127
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,167
Long!

128
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,847
I can't believe you let them win.

129
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,953
Well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

130
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,715
I was frustrated.

131
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:45,913
It's my racket.

132
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,318
Frustrated with you!

133
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:52,155
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

134
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,423
What bothers me...

135
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,067
...is how different
you act around them.

136
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,202
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

137
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,966
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

138
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,779
Listen, I don't sound
like some crazed, drunken pirate.

139
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,539
I know you don't,
but "work Chandler" does.

140
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,447
I don't like work Chandler.
The guy's a suck-up.

141
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,121
Because you said that...

142
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,188
...I'm not putting out tonight!

143
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,627
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.

144
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,996
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

145
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,971
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

146
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,405
That's right. He almost could.

147
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,146
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

148
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,877
Oh, my God!

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,247
Where the hell have you been?

150
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,350
Just, you know, out.

151
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:56,085
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

152
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,826
What were you doing?

153
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,863
I went to a bar, and then...

154
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,434
...I just walked around for a while.

155
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,900
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

156
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,903
He hooked up!

157
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,209
He hooked up.

158
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,610
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.

159
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,181
I can do what I want.

160
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,682
He hooked up!

161
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,879
Tell us about her!

162
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,124
Ross, you left your scarf

163
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,966
Hey, you guys.

164
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,511
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

165
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

166
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,810
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

167
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:00,155
So I'm asking you, please,
just take a moment before you judge me.

168
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,724
Nobody's judging you.

169
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,693
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

170
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,200
...call me.

171
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,406
So I guess you finished your book.

172
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,484
Had some time on our hands, did we?

173
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,710
I know what you guys are going to say.

174
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,550
You two would have
very hairy children.

175
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,158
I didn't know you'd say that.

176
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,163
Ross! Janice?

177
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,298
All right. Hold on, hold on.

178
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,330
This is Ross.

179
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,665
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

180
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,930
He obviously lost his mind.

181
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,707
Look, it's not that crazy. Okay?

182
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,815
But it's Janice! I mean, she's...

183
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,883
...Janice!

184
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,411
How drunk were you?

185
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,749
Janice and I have a lot in common.

186
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:09,054
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

187
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,195
Are you going to see her again?

188
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,196
-Don't put ideas in his head!
-I will see her.

189
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,425
Damn it, Phoebe!

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,800
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

191
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,241
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew you liked him.

192
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,711
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.

193
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,812
My turn? What are you talking about?

194
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,225
I know about you and Chandler.

195
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,995
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

196
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,429
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

197
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,603
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

198
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,737
And you said:

199
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,933
"You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

200
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,552
You're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

201
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,118
Let me know how it turns out.

202
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,892
I wouldn't know, because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

203
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,528
Well, if you had kept listening...

204
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:23,360
...you would have heard me
call him Mister...

205
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,525
...Bigot.

206
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,433
Mr. Bigot.

207
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,477
He tells the most racist jokes.

208
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,974
All right. So that's it.

209
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,877
There's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

210
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,414
Me and Chandler?

211
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,425
Put your $20 down.

212
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,596
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?

213
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,158
All right, let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

214
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,793
And they're off!

215
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,667
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

216
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,842
Judge rules, no violation.

217
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:14,281
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

218
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,784
-What?
-Are you serious?

219
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,957
I opened up to her about all
the stuff that's been happening to me.

220
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,025
I mean, I talked for hours.

221
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,422
It is amazing...

222
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,157
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

223
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,332
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

224
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,334
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

225
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,503
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

226
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,004
Judge rules...

227
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,801
...Nutter Butter.

228
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,980
Tough call.

229
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,956
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should support President Clinton...

230
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,355
...and her husband, Bill.

231
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,891
How do you like your coffee?

232
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,064
-None for me.
-A little sugar.

233
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,861
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.

234
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,342
-That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
-You get used to it.

235
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,977
I don't think that I can.

236
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,681
This will be it for me
on the work things.

237
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,316
I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

238
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,043
I'd rather not be with
this work-weasel guy...

239
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,484
...when I can be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

240
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:34,355
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.

241
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,364
It's not strong enough
to defend itself.

242
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,838
Hear what I said?

243
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,036
What?

244
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,311
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?

245
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,574
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

246
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,842
Excuse me?

247
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,344
-Well, I just
-Honey?

248
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,020
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

249
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,014
Really?

250
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,128
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

251
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,867
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.

252
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,127
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

253
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,438
-You get it now, honey?
-I think I do!

254
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,645
-Thank you, Monica.
-I thought you could use the help.

255
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,945
Coffee in a fight!

256
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,886
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

257
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,355
Sure. Why?

258
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,728
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

259
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,333
She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

260
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,305
She keeps lying to me.

261
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,572
That's it! I'm going over there
and confronting them right now.

262
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,014
Panty raid.

263
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,125
All right, so you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

264
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,204
I'm just not very good at this.

265
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,238
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

266
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,204
-But we're not ready to tell yet.
-I know.

267
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:30,110
Ever since high school, Rachel was the
one person that I told everything to.

268
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,407
I miss that so much now.

269
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,711
She's my best friend.

270
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,620
Oh, my God, Rachel!

271
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,068
What are you doing here?

272
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:56,634
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

273
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,400
...to look at my books.

274
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,646
You know, see them a little better.

275
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,408
Okay, great.

276
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,985
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that...

277
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,483
...I was cleaning it.

278
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,683
He pays me to clean it.

279
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,093
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

280
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,697
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work...

281
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,630
...I'm at my new work.

282
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,603
Good enough. Right?

283
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,005
I'll go look at my books.

284
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,540
Go get back to my new job.

285
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,022
Congratulations on your new job!

286
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,227
Man, she is really gullible.

287
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,535
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

288
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,301
-Actually, I should get going.
-You're sure?

289
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,673
I can stay out as late as you want.

290
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,076
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work

291
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,808
Yes, yes. You did.

292
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,751
-Oh, man!
-What is wrong now?

293
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,850
This isn't what I ordered.

294
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,223
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

295
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,994
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then

296
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,259
I know!

297
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,096
You lose your apartment,
you lose your job...

298
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,331
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

299
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,108
We need to talk.

300
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,415
-Sometimes I feel
-No, no, don't.

301
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,619
I'm going to talk.

302
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,920
I believe...

303
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,023
...that the sun has set...

304
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,423
...on our day in the sun.

305
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,397
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

306
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,435
Unfortunately...

307
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,766
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

308
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,216
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

309
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,810
You're ending this with me because...

310
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,578
...I'm too whiny?

311
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,789
So you're saying...

312
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,225
...I've become so whiny...

313
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,125
...that I...

314
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,994
...annoy you...

315
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,899
...Janice.

316
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,435
Well, yeah!

317
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,232
Oh, my God!

318
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,238
Will you be okay?

319
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,143
I am now.

320
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,320
I guess that's two out of three...

321
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,625
...Joey!

322
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,367
Dude, we got to talk.

323
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,378
I wanted to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

324
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,517
I hope this isn't too weird, but...

325
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,615
...I had a thing with Janice.

326
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,928
You're not mad?

327
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,324
Why would I be mad?

328
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,728
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

329
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,665
You don't fool around with
your friends' ex-girlfriends...

330
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,300
...or possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

331
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,238
I am mad.

332
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,486
But you know,
I'm going to forgive you.

333
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,712
Because that's what friends do.

334
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:09,189
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

335
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,690
Thank you.

336
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,590
But I want you to remember...

337
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,197
...that I forgave you.

338
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,668
I also want you to remember
that I let you live here rent-free.

339
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,368
All right.

340
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,200
And I want you to remember
that I gave you...

341
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,243
...twenty-seven dollars.

342
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,876
No strings attached!

343
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,449
If you can't remember that...

344
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,347
...we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
