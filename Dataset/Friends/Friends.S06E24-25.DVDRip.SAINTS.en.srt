1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:06,738
God, that is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,433
You should know.
You bought, like, a billion of them.

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,938
You didn't get one.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,913
-Tonight's the big night.
-How you gonna ask her?

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,144
We're gonna go to her
favorite restaurant.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:26,417
I'm gonna get her favorite champagne.
She'll know how expensive it is.

7
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:33,257
When the glasses are full, instead of
proposing a toast, I'm gonna propose.

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,932
It sounds perfect!

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,806
-You'll mess it up. Let me do it.
-I won't mess it up.

10
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,034
-If she says no, can I have the ring?
-She won't say no.

11
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,744
If.

12
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,412
-Sure.
-What about me? I want it too.

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,010
-She won't say no.
-I'll let you borrow it.

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,715
Hey, Monica.

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,595
-Give it.
-It's gone.

16
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,557
Phoebe.

17
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,970
Hey, Monica!

18
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,009
We're practically kissing.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,812
The One With the Proposal

20
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:02,617
Anyone free tonight? My boss is
hosting a charity event for kids.

21
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,952
The more people I bring,
the better I look. Monica? Chandler?

22
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,187
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?

23
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,957
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
-What's the big deal?

24
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:19,034
I get mad when Rachel doesn't
remember where we're going.

25
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,336
Where are you going?

26
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,068
-How about you guys?
-Open bar?

27
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,748
-I think so.
-I can do that for the kids.

28
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,117
I'll come. I'm making money.
It's time I give some back.

29
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,017
You could give back
the money you owe me.

30
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,256
Okay. Have a benefit.

31
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,166
Ross, can you go
to a charity event tonight?

32
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,301
I have plans with Elizabeth.

33
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,562
You're already doing
your part for the kids.

34
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:59,038
It's our last night before she
leaves for camp. To be a counselor.

35
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:05,650
I have a question. All jokes aside,
where is this relationship going?

36
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,946
All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.

37
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,723
-Do you see this as long-term?
-I don't know.

38
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,260
-You are 12 years older than her.
-Who's counting?

39
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,897
Well, she is. She's this many.

40
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,128
Ross, she is really young.

41
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,032
Does everyone feel this way?

42
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,338
-Yeah, sort of.
-Sorry.

43
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,502
I thought you were just making jokes.
I had no idea.

44
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,276
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.

45
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,182
But I never notice it,
because she is very mature.

46
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,122
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

47
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,660
Not what she said last night.

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,667
See, now, he could date her.

49
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,100
Will you marry me?

50
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,173
Will you marry me?

51
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,174
Hey, you marry me.

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,455
-What's going on, little elves?
-It's the big night. We wish you luck.

53
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,922
-You have the ring?
-In my pocket.

54
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,893
-Phoebe.
-Wha..?

55
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,438
Will you guys get out of here?
This is a surprise.

56
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,235
Yeah, you guys. Get out of here.

57
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,837
Hey, guys.

58
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,281
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

59
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,987
What's going on?

60
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,058
We're just really...

61
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,925
excited about this charity event
we have to go to.

62
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,762
-Here.
-Thank you.

63
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,273
-So, what's going on here?
-Well, this is a silent auction.

64
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,969
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.

65
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,240
Then the highest bid gets it.

66
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,944
I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?

67
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,386
-Why?
-No, it's nice.

68
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,057
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.

69
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,061
Someone? I brought people.

70
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,828
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.
He's the head of my department.

71
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,905
-And I also brought my friend Joey.
-Shrimp toast!

72
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,270
You know, I don't know where he is.

73
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,604
I hope you'll bid.

74
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,808
Actually, I was about to bid
on this lovely trip to Paris.

75
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,318
-Nice choice. Good luck.
-Thank you.

76
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,612
Okay.

77
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,225
Twenty dollars.

78
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,736
Shut the door! Shut the door!

79
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,633
-What's going on?
-Guys are throwing water balloons.

80
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,642
Call the cops. That's what I did
to kids in my building.

81
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,577
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.

82
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:29,249
I stopped by to see if you wanted
to see this play tonight.

83
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,753
It's excellent. The director is..

84
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,894
-Who drank all the kamikazes?
-Nobody. We put them in here!

85
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,287
You want some?

86
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,397
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.

87
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,970
So this play, what do you think?

88
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,006
-It's gotten great reviews..
-Attack!

89
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,703
-Put your balloons down!
-You put your balloons down!

90
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:00,443
Everybody put their balloons down!

91
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,552
Now, this is a nice suit!

92
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,187
If you'll excuse us...

93
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,858
I would like to speak
to Elizabeth alone for a moment.

94
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,506
Whoa, Liz. Your dad's a bummer.

95
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,202
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.

96
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:33,044
It goes to Emil Alexander
with a high bid of $2300.

97
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,380
So close!

98
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,255
Guys, look. Got me some drinks.

99
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,427
-What are you doing?
-Open bar.

100
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,822
Well, now it's an empty bar.

101
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,798
You can't stand anyone else
enjoying themselves, can you?

102
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,996
Finally, our biggest item.

103
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,707
The 22-foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.

104
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,574
The winning bid
was a whopping $20,000.

105
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,408
I won.

106
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,887
That was my guess.

107
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,290
-What? What? What?
-I guessed $20,000.

108
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,595
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!

109
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,162
What?

110
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,668
I don't have $20,000.

111
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,738
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.

112
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,600
Joey, sit down.

113
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,076
Forget her. You enjoy this.

114
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,024
What are you doing?

115
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,360
"One nation...

116
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,970
under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

117
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,339
I remembered it.
The champagne is here.

118
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,010
-You okay?
-Yes. I'm good. Are you good?

119
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,650
Is everything..? Are you perfect?

120
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,546
Yeah. I'm okay.

121
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,053
Actually, I'm a bit cold.
Can I have your jacket?

122
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,322
No, you can't have my jacket.

123
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,460
Because then I would be cold.

124
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:29,028
If you thought you'd be cold,
you should've brought a jacket.

125
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,264
But, other than that, are you okay?

126
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,842
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

127
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:44,244
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think...

128
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,384
the reason is you.

129
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,310
That's sweet.

130
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,091
Before I met you,
I had really little life.

131
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,064
-And I couldn't imagine growing old..
-Oh, my God.

132
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,895
-I know. But let me say it.
-Richard.

133
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,431
What? I'm Chandler.

134
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,266
Oh, that's Richard.

135
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,475
Maybe he won't see us. Richard!

136
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,819
Monica. Chandler.

137
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,615
I don't know why I did that.

138
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,025
-Good to see you.
-You too. You let your hair grow.

139
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,959
That's right. You always wanted me to.

140
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,124
-I see your mustache is back.
-Well, my nose got lonely.

141
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,438
You don't have a mustache,
which is good.

142
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,638
Chandler. I make jokes
when I'm uncomfortable.

143
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,975
-Hi, I'm Lisa.
-Hi.

144
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,913
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.

145
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,680
Richard, no one's supposed
to know about us.

146
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,759
See? I did it again.

147
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,591
-Chandler, sit down.
-I'll sit down.

148
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,595
-Good to see you.
-Your table's ready, sir.

149
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,324
Good to see you guys.

150
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,130
If you prefer, this table's available.

151
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,835
That might be fun.

152
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,381
-What were you thinking?
-I didn't know it was an auction.

153
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:30,021
I figured I'd take a guess.
Help a charity. Free boat!

154
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,352
Why would a charity give away a boat?

155
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,528
I don't know. Charity?

156
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,955
Well, just buy the damn boat.

157
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,700
Don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

158
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,133
I'm just helping the kids.

159
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,866
How is you drinking helping the kids?

160
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,809
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.

161
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,118
Mr. Tribbiani,
your contribution brings us...

162
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,448
a step closer
to building the youth center.

163
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,593
-I'm so happy you brought him.
-So am I.

164
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,820
I'm curious.
How much is that boat worth?

165
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,559
-I think it was valued at 19,000.
-Hey, I was pretty close.

166
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,597
So, bad news.

167
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,936
I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.

168
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,314
Joey! Joey, good one. He's silly.

169
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,943
Good! Very good!

170
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:44,790
-So I think I'm gonna take off now.
-You can't leave, Joey!

171
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,057
You agreed to buy that boat.
It's a contract.

172
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,997
Plus, if you leave,
my boss will kill me.

173
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,066
I don't have that kind of money.

174
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,504
I know. Okay, okay.
This is what we'll do.

175
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,476
We'll let the next
highest bidder buy it.

176
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,046
Then you'll pay the difference.

177
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,346
Okay. I don't know why the kids
need a youth center anyway.

178
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:13,355
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. I turned out fine.

179
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,215
Not great.

180
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,664
I'm helping the kids so much
I think I'm gonna throw up.

181
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,630
So we're hiding in the bathroom...

182
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,297
I get out. But before she can,
her parents come in.

183
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,775
I hide in the shower.
They start going at it on the floor.

184
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,140
Oh, my God!

185
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,645
I got a good one.

186
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,186
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.

187
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:53,394
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.

188
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,126
As a poet once said,
"In the sweetness of friendship...

189
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,635
Let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures.

190
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,709
In the dew of little things, the heart
finds its morning and is refreshed."

191
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,773
What?

192
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,246
Oh, my God! You guys!

193
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,485
Have we got a story for you.
Guess who we bumped into?

194
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,891
-Who?
-Richard!

195
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,228
Right, that's Richard's
favorite place too.

196
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:37,603
-Oh, you knew that? Good.
-Weren't you going out with Elizabeth?

197
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,644
I was. She was a little busy
with a water balloon fight.

198
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,806
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they can't get out of.

199
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,043
Maybe she is too young for me.

200
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,282
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.

201
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,553
I see what you were talking about.
I don't know what to do.

202
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,426
Weigh the good stuff
about her against the bad.

203
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,764
That's what I did when I
first started... weighing stuff.

204
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,570
Okay, bad stuff.
I'm 12 years older than she is.

205
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,769
The school could fire you.

206
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,812
-She's leaving for three months.
-For camp.

207
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,213
Okay, good stuff.

208
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,511
Well, she's sweet and pretty and..

209
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,213
And the sex is probably great, huh?

210
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,354
It's tender and respectful,
if that's what you mean.

211
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,467
The only thing you need to ask is,
"Do you see a future?"

212
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,996
Do you see yourself marrying her?

213
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,505
My God. You married her, didn't you?

214
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,874
No, I didn't do that. It's just...

215
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:55,347
Okay, honestly, no.
I don't see a big future with her.

216
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,754
Okay, I think that's your answer.

217
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,853
I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.

218
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,757
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful...

219
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,127
you may not get married
at all this year.

220
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,700
-Weren't you supposed to do something?
-Good luck with Elizabeth, my man.

221
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,392
My God, Phoebe, how many have you had?

222
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,656
1, 2, 3... Seven times three..
21!

223
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,696
-You must be just wasted!
-I'm a little tired.

224
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,739
-Next highest bidder is at table one.
-Great.

225
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,071
The guy with the Paris trip
is at table four.

226
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,682
-Why do you care about who won?
-It's a trip for two.

227
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,384
Excuse me.

228
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,624
Is the person who won
the Paris trip at this table?

229
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,559
-That was me.
-Enchante.

230
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:20,761
-Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
-That's me.

231
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:25,165
Well, hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

232
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,511
The Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again...

233
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,775
and I believe you made
a bid of $18,000.

234
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,079
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.

235
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,593
I was relieved I didn't win.
My wife would've killed me.

236
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,356
You kidding? She'll love this boat!

237
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,829
-What is your wife's name?
-Pam.

238
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,469
Just imagine this: The Pam.

239
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,708
I don't think she'd like that.

240
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:03,041
Okay. Imagine this:
The Mr. Bowmont.

241
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,477
-I don't think so.
-Let me paint you a little picture.

242
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:12,680
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your... arms.

243
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,761
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.

244
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,957
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.

245
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,001
You get one of those hats.
People call you captain.

246
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,765
And then when you're old, Cappy.

247
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,706
-It's for a good cause. All right.
-No way! It's mine!

248
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,969
What?

249
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,747
-The stuff you said, I want that!
-But you don't have $20,000!

250
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,618
Who cares? I'll make payments!
I want the Mr. Bowmont!

251
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:57,359
-Oh, my God. You're back.
-Let me see it. Let me see your hand.

252
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,469
Why do you wanna see my hand?

253
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,539
I wanna see what's in your hand.
I wanna see the trash.

254
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,174
It's all dirty.
You should throw this out.

255
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,778
-What did you just do?
-What happened?

256
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,390
-Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
-Oh, no.

257
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,425
I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.

258
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,893
-Now you've ruined it.
-We didn't.

259
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,761
Who walks in a room
and asks to see a person's hands?

260
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,538
A palm reader, a manicurist,
a hand doctor...

261
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,538
-Glove salesman.
-Good one!

262
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,043
This is terrible. What will I do?

263
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:46,616
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.

264
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,276
I'll pretend marriage
is the last thing on my mind.

265
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:55,051
Convince her you're scared
of commitment, that you're a coward.

266
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,195
I can do that.
I've had years of practice.

267
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,457
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

268
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:08,296
Some idiot keeps stuffing
the trash chute with pizza boxes.

269
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,466
That guy is still doing that?

270
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,872
Oh, my God. Let me see your hand!

271
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,608
You're too late!
She already took out the trash!

272
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,770
Look, Elizabeth, we have to talk.

273
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:53,012
I have never had
such a healthy breakup.

274
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,550
She was such a grownup about it.

275
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,415
She didn't seem too immature for me.

276
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,091
Did I just make a huge mistake?

277
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,819
Ross! Wait!

278
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,498
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about..

279
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,759
You suck!

280
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:12,993
What?

281
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,278
Breakup's still on.

282
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,651
Here she comes. Do I look like
I don't wanna get married?

283
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,128
And, also, a little like a French guy.

284
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,632
I never noticed that before.

285
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:55,641
-What are you up to?
-Hanging out. Talking about websites.

286
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,610
We saw this interesting website
about marriage...

287
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:05,950
and how unnecessary it is, a way
for the government to keep tabs.

288
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,750
Yeah, Big Brother.

289
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,492
That's a bit crazy.

290
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:15,395
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the Internet.

291
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:20,530
Got me thinking.
Why would anybody want to get married?

292
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,403
To celebrate the relationship,
solidify the commitment...

293
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,874
declare your love for one another
to the world.

294
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,083
Well, that's good to know.

295
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,019
The Mr. Bowmont is here!

296
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,456
A diner wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

297
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,123
Sure. I love this part.

298
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,070
-Come on in.
-Hi.

299
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,636
-Richard.
-I'm not here to compliment the chef.

300
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,504
I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

301
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,204
Like I have nothing better to do.

302
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,442
So, what's up?

303
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,485
It was great seeing you
the other night.

304
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,519
Good to see you too.

305
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:18,460
-You came to tell me that?
-I came to tell you something else.

306
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,829
I came here to tell you
I still love you.

307
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,736
What? What did you..? What?

308
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,437
I still love you.

309
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,102
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

310
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,714
You're with Chandler, who I like.

311
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,647
If you say he's straight,
I'll believe you.

312
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:46,886
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd regret it.

313
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,619
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

314
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,255
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

315
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:59,163
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...

316
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,396
but I had to tell you.

317
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,267
I wanna spend my life with you.
I wanna marry you.

318
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,541
I wanna have kids with you.

319
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,418
Oh, my God.
Why don't they put chairs back here?

320
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:19,045
Look, I know this is crazy,
but am I too late?

321
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,053
You're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

322
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,662
I know. I was an idiot.

323
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,332
I tried to forget you. I really did.

324
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:33,232
After our last lunch, I spent
six months in Africa trying to forget.

325
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,903
-What did you do there?
-Work with blind kids.

326
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,599
What are you doing to me?

327
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,635
Look, I...

328
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,108
I'm sorry,
but this is not gonna happen.

329
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,219
That's fine. I'll walk away.
I'll never bother you again.

330
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,824
Only if you say Chandler's willing
to give you everything I am.

331
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,425
Well, he is. I mean...

332
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,153
marriage is all he talks about.
My goodness!

333
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,198
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.

334
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,197
You are? Why?

335
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,802
Why?

336
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,740
Because of the government.

337
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,170
Isn't it incredible?

338
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,407
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

339
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,610
I know. They'll be so happy together.

340
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,789
How often do two best friends
fall in love?

341
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,050
-Not that often.
-No.

342
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:33,193
-I'm so happy for them.
-Me too. So happy for them.

343
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,289
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

344
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,566
Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.

345
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,508
I'm probably 98% happy
and maybe 2% jealous.

346
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,979
-I mean, what's 2%? That's nothing.
-Totally.

347
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,121
-I'm like 90/10.
-Yeah. Me too.

348
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,624
Have you guys seen Chandler?

349
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,369
No. But you know
who was looking for you?

350
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,199
Tennille.

351
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:28,342
The marriage stuff you were saying
yesterday? You don't believe that.

352
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,856
Sure, I do. In fact, I think the
concept of marriage is unnatural.

353
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,120
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

354
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,127
Pigs don't mate for life.

355
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,961
A pig can have 100 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

356
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,333
That's an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

357
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,670
Yeah, but that's pigs, not people.

358
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:58,440
If marriage worked, I'd be for it.
Do you know the divorce rate?

359
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,174
Ninety-seven percent!

360
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,847
Wait a minute.

361
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,688
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

362
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:11,384
-Who's to say?
-You! You are to say!

363
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,224
Never say never, but, probably...

364
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,729
yeah, never.

365
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:21,066
Oh, my God. Then what are we
even doing? What is this?

366
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is all this pressure?

367
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,076
Is this some new strategy?

368
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,476
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, mantrap?

369
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,509
You know what? I gotta go.

370
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,279
It's okay. I got a plan.

371
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,591
-We're gonna find love.
-Definitely.

372
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,762
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

373
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:56,799
That's what makes it so easy to be
80% happy for Monica and Chandler.

374
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,735
-A guarantee would be nice.
-What do you mean?

375
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,403
Some friends make a deal.

376
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,143
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

377
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,048
-A backup?
-Exactly.

378
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,984
Yeah, I've got that.

379
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,958
You do?

380
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,457
-Who?
-Joey.

381
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:21,463
-Joey? Are you serious?
-I locked him in years ago.

382
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:29,731
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

383
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,875
Yep. We shook on it.

384
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:36,339
But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

385
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,041
Oh, seriously?

386
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,548
I think his exact words were..

387
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,244
Charming.

388
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,092
He's just a backup.

389
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:00,031
-Hey, Monica.
-Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

390
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,340
-It's for my boat. Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah, it's great.

391
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,068
What's wrong? Talk to the captain.

392
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,484
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

393
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:17,587
-Chandler being difficult?
-I don't want marriage tomorrow.

394
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:22,249
But I wanna know we're going
somewhere, that I'm not wasting time.

395
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,487
-You know Chandler.
-No, I don't know Chandler.

396
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,929
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

397
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,668
-Maybe you changed.
-I didn't change.

398
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,834
Maybe that's the problem.

399
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,409
-What?
-Chandler is a complex fellow.

400
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,308
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

401
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,884
Is that some kind of boat talk?

402
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,050
I haven't totally decided
how to talk on my boat yet.

403
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,455
Does he think
I'll wait around for nothing?

404
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,825
Face it.
Chandler is against marriage.

405
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,897
And always will be.

406
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,036
There's some people
who do wanna marry me.

407
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,536
-There are?
-Yeah. Richard.

408
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,908
Richard said he wants to marry you?

409
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,411
-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
-That's right.

410
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,480
Chandler loves marriage!

411
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,883
You just said he hates marriage!

412
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,649
"He's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife"!

413
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,987
"He's against marriage
and always will be"!

414
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,630
You got that from what I said?

415
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,964
After the Cretaceous Period,
the dinosaurs were gone.

416
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,007
What happened, you guys?

417
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,518
-Rach.
-Hey, you.

418
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,782
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

419
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,317
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

420
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,623
Thanks. I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

421
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,992
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

422
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,603
Yeah. Love.
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

423
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,669
-I guess so.
-So, what do you say we make a pact?

424
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,335
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

425
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,744
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other...

426
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,977
we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises.

427
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,917
No, like, "What's that?"

428
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,490
-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
-Exactly.

429
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,824
Yeah. I already have one.

430
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,657
-What? Who?
-Phoebe.

431
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,393
Phoebe?

432
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,772
But she just said Joey is her backup.

433
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,135
Oh, I don't think so.

434
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:56,837
We just spoke. She said
that she and Joey made a deal.

435
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,485
That's impossible. We have had
a deal for years. We shook on it.

436
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:05,884
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

437
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,928
Gunther, it's Joey. Is Chandler there?

438
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,532
Listen. What kind of muffins
do they serve at sea?

439
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,334
Where the hell have you been?!

440
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,167
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

441
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,507
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

442
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,309
-What?
-I've been trying to find you.

443
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:37,079
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

444
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,779
-Oh, my God!
-I know! They suck!

445
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,256
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

446
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,758
-I know!
-What..?

447
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,059
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

448
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,632
Will you help me?

449
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,535
Look, I don't think us getting
our asses kicked is a solution, okay?

450
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,178
-Look, just go and find Monica.
-You're right.

451
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,745
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring...

452
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,042
I'm gonna go find her
and I'm gonna propose!

453
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,043
Dude! Dude! Dude!

454
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,588
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

455
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,434
Hi.

456
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,273
Hi.

457
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,812
I don't know why I'm here.

458
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,041
I didn't ask.

459
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,718
-You wanna come in?
-I don't know.

460
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,220
Oh, okay.

461
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,523
I'll just leave the door open
and sit on the couch.

462
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,866
-Chandler is such an idiot!
-Drink?

463
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,163
-Scotch on the..
-Rocks with a twist?

464
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,897
I remember.

465
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,871
You still smoking cigars?

466
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,215
No, no. That's art.

467
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,944
If it bothers you,
I can put my art out.

468
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,656
No, that's okay.

469
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,655
So, Monica, let me ask you a question.

470
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,798
Since we broke up, do you ever...

471
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,627
think about me?

472
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,462
Actually, I thought about you
a few months ago.

473
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,607
-Really?
-But it's because...

474
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,539
I had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

475
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,306
-Who is it?
-Edward Nevsky.

476
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,945
He's no good.

477
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:50,181
Do you ever think about me...

478
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,116
-in a non-eye-doctor way?
-No.

479
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,661
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever done.

480
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,001
I never let myself think about you.

481
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,095
Wow.

482
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,012
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

483
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:20,048
-You can't have two backups!
-Of course I can.

484
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,118
It's good sense
to back up your backup.

485
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,949
-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
-What?

486
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,622
Hey, Phoebe! We're both your backup?

487
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,523
How could you do this to me?

488
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,433
Why are you complaining?
You were both aware of the situation.

489
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,536
-I was not!
-No, we weren't!

490
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:43,366
This kind of backtalk won't fly
when we're married.

491
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,574
You can't have both. Pick one.

492
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,301
-Pick me!
-No, pick me!

493
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:53,473
-I don't wanna end up an old maid.
-All right. Well, let's see.

494
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,016
Ross is a good father.

495
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,546
But...

496
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,087
Joey has a boat. This is hard.

497
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,021
This is crazy.
I wanna switch to Rachel.

498
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,889
-I wanna switch to Rachel too.
-No, wait. Just wait.

499
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,227
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

500
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,425
Just remember my promise:

501
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,663
If we get married, three times a week.

502
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,431
Oh, my God. Phoebe...

503
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,076
I'm talking about massages.

504
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,438
No, I'm not.

505
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,519
I know how to settle it.
We'll do this.

506
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,211
I'm gonna write "Joey"
on one napkin...

507
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:37,224
and "Ross" on the other napkin
and we're gonna pick one.

508
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,226
That person will be our backup. Okay?

509
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,023
-Sounds fair.
-All right.

510
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,531
Good. Switching them up.

511
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,870
-Pick one.
-Left.

512
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,835
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

513
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,514
-Ross.
-Joey.

514
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,814
-We should switch.
-Absolutely.

515
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,157
I missed you,
you ugly flat-faced old freak.

516
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,888
Excuse me?

517
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,561
Him.

518
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:24,574
I missed this apartment.
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

519
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,266
I should be with a grownup, you know?

520
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,776
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

521
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,577
Maybe someone with...

522
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,614
a license to practice medicine.

523
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,718
Or a mustache.

524
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,687
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

525
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,829
I need someone
who wants the same things.

526
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,491
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

527
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,836
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

528
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,701
I think that's fair.

529
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,844
Please, don't even talk
to me about fair.

530
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,413
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

531
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,084
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

532
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,449
Believe me, nothing
about this is fair. Nothing.

533
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,352
-Nothing! Nothing!
-It's okay.

534
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,228
Nothing.

535
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,363
I don't know.

536
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,197
I don't know.

537
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,305
I know.

538
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,211
I have to figure some..

539
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,077
Some stuff, before I can...

540
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,818
I understand.

541
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,352
Take as much time as you want.

542
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,888
Ten, even 20 minutes, if you need it.

543
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,591
I'll be here. Not smoking.

544
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,870
Where is she?

545
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,083
I'm not scared of you.

546
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,582
She's not here. And please come in.

547
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,289
Scotch on the rocks...

548
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,959
with a twist, on a coaster.

549
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,718
Monica?

550
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,931
Okay, she was here. But she left.

551
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,499
Where did she go?

552
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,329
She said she had to think things over.

553
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,940
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

554
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,905
Look, nothing happened.

555
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,104
Nothing? So you didn't tell
my girlfriend you love her?

556
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,076
Well, all right, one thing happened.

557
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:51,751
You know what you did?
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

558
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,550
You made my girlfriend think!

559
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,389
Well, I'm sorry.

560
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,395
-What's to think about? I love her.
-Well...

561
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,898
I'm willing to offer her
things that you aren't.

562
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,594
I'm willing to offer her
those things. I had a plan...

563
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:14,142
to throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

564
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,505
If it helps, it worked very well.

565
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,750
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

566
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,155
This isn't fair.

567
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,690
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

568
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:34,831
This is my chance. I won't blow it,
because we are meant for each other.

569
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,331
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

570
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,201
I was gonna propose tonight.

571
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,770
-You were gonna propose?
-Yeah, I even...

572
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:52,111
got a ring. Did you get a ring?

573
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,977
No, I don't have a ring.

574
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,715
You go get her, Chandler.

575
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,888
And can I give you a piece of advice?

576
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,962
If you do get her...

577
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,695
don't let her go.

578
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,336
Trust me.

579
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,765
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.

580
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,272
I know.

581
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,072
I hate that.

582
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,158
-I've gotta find Monica.
-She's gone.

583
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,970
-What?
-She had a bag and she left.

584
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,139
-What?
-She was all crying...

585
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,673
She said you guys
want different things.

586
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:57,109
-Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?
-I told her everything.

587
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:01,580
-But she wouldn't believe me.
-Well, where..? Where did she go?

588
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:07,155
To her parents'. She said you shouldn't
call. But if I were you, I would.

589
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,923
-I can't believe I ruined this.
-I am so sorry, man.

590
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,632
You wanted it to be a surprise.

591
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,043
Oh, my God.

592
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,084
Chandler...

593
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,398
in all my life...

594
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,795
I never thought
I would be so lucky...

595
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,967
as to fall in love with my best...

596
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,969
My best...

597
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,982
There's a reason why
girls don't do this!

598
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,477
I'll do it. I thought...

599
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,551
Wait, I can do this.

600
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,522
I thought that it mattered...

601
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,328
what I said or where I said it.

602
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,062
Then I realized...

603
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,307
the only thing that matters
is that you...

604
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:40,582
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

605
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,621
And if you let me...

606
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:50,592
I'll spend all my life trying
to make you feel the same way.

607
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,902
Monica...

608
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,407
will you marry me?

609
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,168
Yes.

610
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,357
I knew you were likely to take a wife!

611
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,527
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

612
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,659
Come in! Come in!

613
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,603
We're engaged!

614
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,215
This is the least jealous
I've ever been.

615
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,081
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

616
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:56,150
Hell, he's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!
