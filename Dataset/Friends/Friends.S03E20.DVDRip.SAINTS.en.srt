1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,237
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,464
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,643
- Oh, my God! They took my idea!
- That was you?

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,110
Okay, there you go.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,578
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,250
Oh, that's so...

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,419
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,222
Oh, my.

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,867
The One With a Chick and a Duck

10
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,642
- Hey.
- Hey.

11
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,408
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

12
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,979
So that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,782
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

14
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,755
You should come out with Ross and me.

15
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,829
Anything is better than sitting
here crying all day about Kate.

16
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:44,334
I was crying because
nobody believed Quincy's theory.

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,933
I'm gonna be on TV!

18
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,335
- No way!
- Yeah.

19
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,337
They're putting together a panel
to talk about these fossils in Peru.

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,138
The Discovery Channel's filming it!

21
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,044
Oh, my God!
Who's gonna watch that?

22
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,179
- Thanks. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,451
I saw a girl with that vest.

24
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,746
Thanks.

25
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,424
Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

26
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,759
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

27
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,067
Unfortunately, most of these little guys
won't live to see the 4th of July...

28
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,573
...because, as a result of
improper care, they will be dead.

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,909
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

30
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:33,609
I was watching this commercial on TV,
and, man, those things are cute!

31
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,956
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,593
Pete, you're back!
Hey, check this out!

33
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,918
Skates!

34
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:50,198
You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

35
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,526
So how was your trip?

36
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,373
What'd you bring me?

37
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,007
Hotel toiletries from Japan!

38
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,904
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

39
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,481
You know what that says in English?
Made in Texas.

40
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,445
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

41
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,554
Regular or decaf?

42
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,984
Whichever's closest.

43
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,464
- So ask me what I did today.
- So, what did you do today, Pete?

44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,191
I bought a restaurant, and I'd
like you to be the chef.

45
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,200
What?

46
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,270
Can you believe he
offered me a restaurant?

47
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,572
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

48
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,114
This has been my dream since
I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

49
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,012
...and opened Easy Monica's Bakery.

50
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,259
I would kill for this job.
I can totally do this job...

51
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,262
...and God knows, I've paid my dues.

52
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,434
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,540
You're still not attracted to him at all?

54
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:07,475
No. I mean, how could I accept
a restaurant from him? I can't.

55
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,840
I couldn't accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the 7th grade.

56
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,145
But, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

57
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,548
What, honey?

58
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,920
My side still hurts from when
you crashed into me yesterday.

59
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,719
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,224
Oh, God!

61
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,791
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

62
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,262
Got a job on a riverboat?

63
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,640
You know what? I didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

64
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,870
You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,344
I see. So this suit is making a point.

66
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,814
Now that you're on your own, you're
free to look as stupid as you'd like.

67
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,545
You like it, right?

68
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,192
Absolutely! I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

69
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,788
Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.

70
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,656
- What were you gonna tell us?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,560
- Was it how you invented the cotton gin?
- Okay, goodbye.

72
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,866
- Was that a little harsh?
- Are you kidding?

73
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,438
Remember when you used to wear
that gray sweat suit.

74
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,404
And I used to call you the Hindenberg.

75
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,106
No.

76
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,571
My mistake.

77
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,145
So after you put the suggestion
in the box...

78
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,413
...how long did it take
for the roller skating to happen?

79
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,590
About three months.

80
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:29,294
Okay, so I guess that's about two
weeks before the topless thing kicks in.

81
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,397
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,131
I got you something.
Open it! Open it!

83
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,731
Okay.

84
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,305
It's a chicken.

85
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,876
It's cute, huh?

86
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,380
You guys, do you know
anything about chicks?

87
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,846
Fowl? No.

88
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,485
Women? No.

89
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,888
They are a huge responsibility.

90
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,925
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

91
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,360
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

92
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,124
Well, no problem there.

93
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,699
Easy, Lenny.

94
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,410
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

95
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,012
Okay, here's the thing.

96
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,116
Oh, no. Not "the thing."
I hate "the thing."

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,583
What's "the thing"?

98
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,125
I can't do it.

99
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,660
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

100
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,592
...but you have these feelings for me.

101
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,025
Wait. That's what you're worried about?

102
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,201
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

103
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,864
I was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but I met somebody else on my trip.

104
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,411
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
We met on the plane.

105
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,944
She asked to finish my peanuts.

106
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,208
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

107
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,318
Yeah, I just...
I mean, I got tired of waiting.

108
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:08,722
That's great. I'm sorry,
but I'm so happy for you.

109
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,188
- And now I can work for you!
- I guess you can.

110
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,399
Oh, my God! This is incredible!

111
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,829
You know what? I'm gonna roll
right into that office and quit!

112
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,663
All right!

113
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,904
- Could you give me a little push?
- Yeah, sure.

114
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,204
- Good luck!
- I'm quitting!

115
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,749
I'm okay! I'm all right!

116
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,753
That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

117
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,654
What?

118
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,729
I'm just saying, this woman,
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

119
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,965
- Why would you say that?
- You're still into Monica.

120
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,138
You said there's somebody else,
so she'd agree to work with you.

121
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,602
If you spend a lot of time together,
maybe something might happen.

122
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,975
You're good. You're good.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,906
No, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic.

124
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,285
It's a substantial gift.

125
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,281
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her though?

126
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,185
Absolutely. I promise.
Tell her what?

127
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,389
Thanks a lot.

128
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,426
No, I'm serious.
I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

129
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,826
Okay, but this is the last time.

130
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,438
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,302
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

132
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,569
Chicken

133
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,637
- Hey.
- Hey.

134
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,338
How's she doing?

135
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,772
She?

136
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,113
Yeah, don't you think it's a she?

137
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,319
I don't know.

138
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,128
I can't tell. Whatever it was
went back in too quickly.

139
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,831
Anyway, I gotta go change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,200
Excuse me?

141
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,475
What?

142
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,036
I stayed home while
you were at rehearsal...

143
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,813
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

144
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,049
Who was up from 2:00 this
morning until 5:00 this morning...

145
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,320
...trying to get her back to sleep?

146
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,890
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

147
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,286
Oh, here it comes.

148
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,053
Yes! Here it comes!
I'm stuck here all day!

149
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,366
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us.

150
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,568
And then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

151
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,773
Well, I don't think so, mister!

152
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,968
I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

153
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,872
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

154
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,086
That's not what I said.
I just meant...

155
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,914
I know what you meant!

156
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,861
Have you noticed that ever since
we got this chick...

157
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,232
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

158
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,238
I don't know. Maybe we weren't
ready to have a chick.

159
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,638
I sure want one someday though.

160
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,970
I know. I know.

161
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,048
I'll take her back tomorrow.

162
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,014
You think we'll get our $3 back?

163
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,118
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,959
- I can't believe you still have that.
- We're taking her back.

165
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,993
No, that ridiculous thing on your face.

166
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,892
- Thank you.
- All right?

167
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,296
I have that TV thing in, like, two hours,
and I need your help, okay?

168
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,596
What do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

169
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,637
The brown one brings out your eyes.

170
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,036
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

171
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,373
Really?

172
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,425
That aspirin dance really works.

173
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,867
- Oh, my God. Is that still...?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

174
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,968
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am.

175
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,934
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that.

176
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,575
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

177
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,747
I have got to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

178
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,179
There's a lot of people there
that I have to meet.

179
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,479
I'm sure you'll make a great
impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel Greene.

180
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,089
It's nice to meet you."

181
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,622
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

182
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,194
I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

183
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,922
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

184
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,862
Look, either help me or go.

185
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,766
Fine. I'll go.

186
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,569
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

187
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,570
Sure. I'll help you.

188
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,006
Good! Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

189
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,899
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

190
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,601
Would you please help me
with this too?

191
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,607
- Okay, let's use this brush.
- Okay.

192
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,980
- This stuff?
- Careful.

193
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,170
- Okay.
- Light.

194
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,748
Just sweep it across the lid.
Just sweep it.

195
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,648
Sorry!

196
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,914
That's just poking me in the eye.

197
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,319
I'm sorry. Close.

198
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,560
- Just sweep it.
- I'm sweeping.

199
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,826
Sweep, sweep.

200
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,356
Okay, now make it even
because we don't...

201
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,555
What?

202
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,760
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

203
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,871
You don't wear enough of this.

204
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:02,044
Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

205
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,908
Close your eye.
You're gonna like this better.

206
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,550
- Close, close.
- Blow it.

207
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:13,418
Sorry. Because I think this will make
you a little more sophisticated.

208
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,994
Sophisticated like a hooker?

209
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

210
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,029
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

211
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,168
I'm checking out
the restaurant with Pete.

212
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,836
Monica, I am so excited for you!

213
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,538
I have to tell you something.

214
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,377
- What?
- I can't tell you.

215
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,640
Wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell
me something that you could tell me?

216
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,818
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

217
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,487
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to all my gods.

218
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,357
Does it have to do with
Ross and Rachel?

219
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,996
No.

220
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,166
- Does it have to do with Joey?
- No.

221
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,858
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock he keeps by his bed?

222
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,037
No, but let's come back to that later.

223
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,703
There you go!
Good enough for your party?

224
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,982
Sure.

225
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:23,888
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from purchasing.

226
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,758
Come on!
Okay, come on.

227
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,026
All right, I gotta go,
so good luck at the party, okay?

228
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,136
Oh, wait. Ross, could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

229
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,972
Sure. Okay.

230
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,201
Okay, great. Okay, just turn around.

231
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,647
What?

232
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,405
I don't want you to see me naked.

233
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,952
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million
times. I ate hot fudge off you naked.

234
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,315
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

235
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,320
Yeah, but that was different.
We were going out then.

236
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,290
Now it's weird.

237
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,056
Rach, you know, I can see
you naked anytime I want.

238
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,292
What?

239
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:08,437
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See?

240
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,138
- Ross, stop that!
- I'm sorry.

241
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,214
Come on! I don't want you thinking
of me like that anymore.

242
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,145
Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

243
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,910
It's one of my rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

244
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,424
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

245
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,821
I'm sorry. It will never happen...

246
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,496
Wait a minute! Wait, wait.

247
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,097
Now there are 100 of you,
and I'm the king!

248
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,162
- Ross.
- Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

249
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,336
All right. Fine.

250
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,685
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

251
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,587
Oh, my God. All right, look, look.
Okay. Rach!

252
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,988
Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

253
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,025
- Okay, I do. I really do.
- Okay?

254
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,754
I'm gonna get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

255
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,795
Wait! You're not gonna come with me?

256
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,633
Of course I am.

257
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,738
I just have to make a call.

258
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:17,909
- Okay
- Okay.

259
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,134
Thank you.

260
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,206
What's wrong?

261
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,045
I'm sorry. I just can't go
to the hospital looking like this.

262
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,482
- Does it involve travel?
- No.

263
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,919
Does it involve clogs?

264
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,662
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

265
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,621
- Clogs.
- No.

266
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,356
- Claws?
- No.

267
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,004
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross
or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.

268
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,600
- What about Pete?
- No.

269
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,437
What is it?

270
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,941
- What about Pete?
- I don't know!

271
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,914
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

272
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,581
- Phoebe, would you just tell me?
- I can't!

273
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,689
- Okay, I gotta go.
- But you're so close! No!

274
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,861
Does it involve
Pete's computer company?

275
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,065
Just go! You're never gonna get it!

276
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,602
I know.

277
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,471
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

278
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,476
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

279
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,386
I love you both.

280
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,083
But in very different ways.

281
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,191
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,189
What are you doing? I thought
you were gonna take her back today.

283
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,368
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

284
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,232
So then I took her to the shelter,
and you know what I found out?

285
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,308
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her!

286
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,745
I'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

287
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,986
Okay, good, good, good, because I was
kind of having second thoughts too.

288
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:16,127
Okay, and it's not just chicks.
It's all kinds of other animals.

289
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,886
That's horrible.
You did the right thing, man.

290
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,156
Thanks. I'm glad
you see it that way.

291
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,202
Funny story!

292
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,974
I don't believe this!

293
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,517
Look at this refrigerator!
It's gigantic!

294
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,488
I mean, I could live in this thing!
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

295
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,686
Oh, my God! Look at these spider
burners! I love spider burners!

296
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,365
So you like it?

297
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,399
It is so perfect!
Thank you so much.

298
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,104
You're welcome.

299
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,211
Did you just smell my hair?

300
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,745
No! No way! What? No.

301
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,347
- Oh, God.
- What?

302
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,886
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

303
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,989
No, I'm just excited about
the restaurant, that's all.

304
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,362
- Pete.
- Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

305
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,795
No, it's not bad.
It's not bad at all.

306
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,864
It's really nice.

307
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,100
The only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

308
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,902
You may be okay with getting hurt...

309
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,307
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

310
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,909
That's why I can't take this job.

311
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,343
What?

312
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,417
We probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

313
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,754
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,188
Okay, yeah.

315
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,386
I mean, if that's
really what you want, okay.

316
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,269
Okay, bye.

317
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,208
- I'm sorry things didn't work out...
- Shut up for a second...

318
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,074
...and let me just see something.

319
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,760
You'd tell me the truth, right?

320
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:35,123
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

321
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:40,964
Okay, now you stay out here,
and you think about what you did!

322
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,209
- That's a duck!
- That's a bad duck!

323
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,546
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

324
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,008
What thing? What thing?

325
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,914
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

326
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:57,913
Easy.

327
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:04,095
Now, when you come back, I hope you
remember that that chick is not a toy!

328
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,197
What thing? What is this thing?

329
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,768
I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

330
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,205
Oh, my God!

331
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,204
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

332
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,173
Because I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

333
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,440
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

334
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,684
- I cannot believe you.
- What?

335
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,856
That is the sweetest thing.

336
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,701
You should get some sleep.

337
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,403
- So I'll...
- Sorry I spoiled your evening.

338
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,872
No, that's...
No, as long as you're okay.

339
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,170
So I'll see you tomorrow.

340
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,780
Yeah.

341
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,518
See you.

342
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,567
What did you do?

343
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,373
What you doing?

344
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,413
Having a swim.

345
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,953
What about the chick?

346
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,855
Chicks don't swim.

347
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,557
Are you sure?

348
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,052
I don't know.

349
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,363
- Should we try?
- Sure.

350
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,835
See, I told you.
They don't swim.

351
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,373
- Wait, give him a minute.
- No!

352
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,946
It's okay.
It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
