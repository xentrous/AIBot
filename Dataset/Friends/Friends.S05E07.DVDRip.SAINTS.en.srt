1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,233
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,136
No, look.

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,999
That's a pig.

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,139
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,976
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,346
-What?
-Why?

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,285
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:29,622
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,353
Didn't you sign a lease?

10
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,998
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,360
You can stay with us.

12
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,128
Anything you need.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,173
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

14
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,206
...so we can make fun of your hair.

15
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,045
You got it.

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:54,011
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.

17
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,779
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.

18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,058
-What?
-He thought you said gonad.

19
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,860
The One Where Ross Moves In

20
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,744
If every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

21
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,782
Oh, Larry!

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,945
Do health inspectors
work on commission?

23
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,554
No, bribes.

24
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,859
-It's okay to laugh?
-I was just kidding.

25
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,122
-I'll check the kitchen floor.
-Knock yourself out.

26
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,561
I don't get violations.
You could eat beans off that floor.

27
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,967
But don't, because that'd be a violation.

28
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,532
Yummy!

29
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,606
Yeah, I'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

30
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,745
A ninety-eight.

31
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,215
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

32
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,583
That is a Section 5 violation.

33
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,952
Now look, Larry, honey.

34
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,828
I wrote the book on Section 5.

35
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,554
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

36
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,496
-Where's your hat?
-In the kitchen. I'll get it.

37
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,267
There's the two points!

38
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,803
You should really read
that book you wrote.

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,153
You saw the hat in the kitchen and
knew she'd go in hatless to get it.

40
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,756
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

41
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,321
I don't know about that.

42
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,088
But then I could be
your sidekick, Voonda.

43
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,295
Maybe I could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

44
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,330
She would love that...

45
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,132
...since you know
all the clean places to eat.

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,639
I'll call you.

47
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,941
He's so funny!

48
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,182
Thank you.

49
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,130
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

50
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,728
He's not great.

51
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,025
But he's dealing with it.
Wait, you're not

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,637
I can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

53
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,340
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

54
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,306
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

55
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,879
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

56
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,885
-Two pounds of mocha java.
-It's Danny.

57
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,518
Are you going to go out again?

58
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,559
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

59
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,856
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt. I'm all:

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,592
And then nothing.

61
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,565
Wow, thirsty.

62
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,230
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

63
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,004
-Fun.
-Great!

64
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,678
I'm looking forward to it.

65
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,072
See you!

66
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,779
So I guess we won't
be warming his house.

67
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,082
All right, I see what he's doing.

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,353
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

69
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,754
And you won't do that.

70
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,365
That's right!

71
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,695
Because that would give him
the control.

72
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,065
So now he comes up with this
"I've got a party" thing...

73
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,902
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

74
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,044
Blew up in his face, didn't it?

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,311
So there is no party?

76
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,218
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

77
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,920
But the power?

78
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,282
That is still up for grabs.

79
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,487
You follow me?

80
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,021
I think so.

81
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,095
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

82
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,554
Exactly!

83
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,462
Then why didn't he invite me?

84
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,572
To throw me off.

85
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,648
Hey, roomies!

86
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,949
I love what you've done
with the place.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,025
I know it's a lot of boxes.

88
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,164
-I appreciate you letting me stay here.
-Not a problem.

89
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,494
Since you'll be here a while...

90
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,671
...we could put your name
on the answering machine.

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,836
I hope you don't mind...

92
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,442
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little.

93
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,509
Check it out.

94
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,211
We will

95
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,853
We will call you back

96
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,526
Pretty cool.

97
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,963
-You're fake laughing too, right?
-The tears are real.

98
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,732
You look beautiful this evening.

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,039
Show me the badge again.

100
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,213
Shiny.

101
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,909
You mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

102
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,246
You are just nonstop!

103
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,896
-We're out of here.
-Why?

104
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,936
I saw 10 violations.
I'm shutting this place down!

105
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,504
-You have the power to do that?
-This does.

106
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,376
Shut it down.

107
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,185
What are you doing?

108
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,391
Nothing.

109
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,089
You built a fort, didn't you?

110
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,702
Kind of.

111
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,396
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

112
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,973
All I heard for four years
through college was...

113
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,741
You should have gone out
once in a while.

114
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,441
-I hate this thing!
-Come on, Chandler.

115
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,414
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

116
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,752
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

117
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,392
Can't believe that Larry closed down
Churman's. I love that place.

118
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,967
You should have heard
about all their violations.

119
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,163
Larry said that they should call it Vermin's.

120
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,366
That guy just plain kills me.

121
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,015
I wanted to invite you to the party.

122
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,545
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.

123
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,847
Actually, I think
I'm going to be busy.

124
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,114
You are?

125
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,390
Remember, I've got that gala?

126
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,630
What's the gala for?

127
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,966
It's a regatta gala.

128
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,964
Do you sail?

129
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,638
No, but I support it.

130
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,005
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

131
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,412
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

132
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,985
What one?

133
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,748
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

134
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,152
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes...

135
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,093
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

136
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,697
But I said no...

137
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,768
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

138
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,336
So the ball is in his court?

139
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,666
Ball?

140
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,740
No, there's no ball.

141
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,213
Hey, Phoebe, you want to join us?

142
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,009
-Oh, sure, yeah. Where is this from?
-It's from Sun Ling's.

143
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,985
Oh, Larry just told me
something about Sun Ling.

144
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,454
Oh, no, thank you.

145
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,363
Joey, please.

146
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,796
Sorry.

147
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,581
Hello, children.

148
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,986
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

149
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,831
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes.

150
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,432
Come on!

151
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,172
I have one question.

152
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,072
What is the deal with this?

153
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,172
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

154
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,407
No, the quiet down thing.

155
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,053
You mean this.

156
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,556
I don't know how much more
I can take.

157
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,890
Did you know he taped over my Baywatch
tape with a show about bugs?

158
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,965
My God!

159
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,733
What if that had been porn?

160
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,672
All right, this may be tough...

161
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,434
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.

162
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,911
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.

163
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,740
Let's have a game.

164
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,644
Fellas?

165
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,987
So he's out of here.

166
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,533
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.

167
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:56,271
I took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

168
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,279
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

169
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,181
I don't know. Clean places?

170
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,616
Yum!

171
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,685
It's Danny.

172
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,956
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.

173
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,726
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

174
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,540
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

175
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,302
The fake kind.

176
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,146
-I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
-We have a ladle.

177
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,744
See you at the party.

178
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,384
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."

179
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,323
I'm done. You want anything?
Sports? International?

180
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,762
Apartment listings?

181
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,559
I'll take sports.

182
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,103
Mine!

183
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,399
All right, international.

184
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,700
That's mine too.

185
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,271
I'm Italian.

186
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,345
I could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

187
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,782
Not even on page seven?

188
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,490
You're right.
Here's an affordable place.

189
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:21,029
Two-bedroom, close to work.
It's available in five weeks.

190
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,201
What about that circled one?

191
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,868
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

192
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,802
But it's available now.

193
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,100
Isn't it?

194
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,800
Yes, it is.

195
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,046
Let's go look at it!

196
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,372
There we go!

197
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:45,650
Guys, would you chip in for some
new air filters for the purifier?

198
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,993
I mean, after all,
we are all using it.

199
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,250
Let's go quicker!

200
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,841
Oh, my God!

201
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,637
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.

202
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,017
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

203
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,016
Somebody was using his head.

204
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,451
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

205
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,494
I think this is it.

206
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,469
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

207
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,174
But this place is available now.

208
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,503
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

209
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,550
So you think I should
take this place?

210
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,450
It's perfect!

211
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,020
How about you?

212
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,697
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

213
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,463
I see what you guys are saying.

214
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,538
I'll go downstairs
and fill out an application.

215
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,139
We are bad people.

216
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,712
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

217
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,517
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

218
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,226
Ready for dinner?

219
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,431
-Absolutely.
-Great.

220
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,860
You wanted to go to
the Italian place on Bleecker St.?

221
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,831
I love that place!

222
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,537
So, no.

223
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,235
How about Mama Lozetti's?

224
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,902
Sure.

225
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,912
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

226
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,746
No, this place is totally healthy.

227
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,508
This milk is mine.
I bought this today...

228
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,621
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?

229
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,521
Okay, let's go.

230
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,860
Hey, buddy.

231
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:13,196
Health Code 11 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

232
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,703
But then I have to go
all the way around.

233
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,876
So you choose convenience
over health?

234
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:24,139
Would you be interested in a free coffee?

235
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,943
Stop, Larry.

236
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,313
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

237
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,455
It was exciting at first.

238
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:39,096
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

239
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,000
I suppose I could give him a warning.

240
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,497
Thank you.

241
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,493
Go, go!

242
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,335
If, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

243
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,845
...I know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

244
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,517
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

245
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,451
That was a nice place.

246
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,687
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

247
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,091
What do we do?

248
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,128
I don't know.

249
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,999
Maybe pizza?

250
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,172
About Ross!

251
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,150
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

252
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,553
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable

253
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:46,196
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that barks into the night.

254
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,465
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

255
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,327
He's a tap dancer.

256
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,502
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

257
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,402
He's a pimp!

258
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,572
There you go. He's a pimp.

259
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,874
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

260
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,802
-Okay, honey, I'm ready.
-What are you doing?

261
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,501
I am going to wander into the party
and I will be all, you know:

262
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,307
"I don't need this,
I'm coming from a regatta gala."

263
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,317
Did you get this out of a book?

264
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,753
Monica, honey, this is as real as it gets.

265
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,132
This is never going to work.
He's right there.

266
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,429
Just go say hi.

267
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:05,666
I have to go downstairs and back up,
as if I'm coming home from the gala.

268
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,006
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

269
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,143
What's going on?

270
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,322
This is a great party.
Great food.

271
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,984
You know, most parties, it's all
chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

272
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,691
So...

273
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,855
What's this?

274
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,690
Salad.

275
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,867
And what's this?

276
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,506
Bread.

277
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,672
Aren't you a chef?

278
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,575
Right, tonight was your party.

279
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,912
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.

280
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,589
Well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

281
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,320
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

282
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,099
Whose court is the ball in now?

283
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,465
I thought there wasn't a ball.

284
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,708
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

285
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,603
Ball's flying all over the place.

286
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,045
This is my friend, Tom.

287
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,943
This is the girl I told you about.

288
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,143
Come on!
You telling people about me?

289
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,284
I think you two
could really hit it off.

290
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,620
I'm gonna go mingle.

291
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,631
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."

292
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,464
At ease, soldier!

293
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,198
I'm sorry?

294
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,846
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.

295
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,038
You're Danny's wingman, right?

296
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,683
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

297
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,883
I'm going to go talk to a friend.

298
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,989
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

299
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,218
Go tell him, "Nice try."

300
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,326
He just keeps lobbing them up...

301
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,902
...and I keep knocking them
right out of the park.

302
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,233
I think I need a drink.

303
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,509
Ninety-eight...

304
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,183
...ninety-nine...

305
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,283
...one hundred!

306
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,680
Okay. Go.

307
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,014
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

308
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,758
Here we go, here we go.

309
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,596
So I didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

310
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,066
You're kidding?

311
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:51,436
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so...

312
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,044
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

313
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,113
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

314
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:02,786
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

315
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,818
Please, just stay.

316
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,283
Are you sure?

317
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,620
-Definitely.
-You have to stay.

318
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,133
So I'm a pimp, huh?

319
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,638
It's okay.

320
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,173
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

321
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,006
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

322
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:35,413
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just...

323
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,370
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

324
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,007
The cowboy hat's a little much.

325
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,175
Come on, it's fun!

326
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,269
All right.

327
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,389
Isn't this a woman's hat?

328
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,292
Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!
