1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,996
Hey, how much you give me
to eat this whole jar of olives?

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,537
I won't give you anything,
but you'll owe me $2.95.

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,105
Done.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,440
I need an atlas!
I need an atlas!

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,641
Why? Do you have a report due?

6
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,012
I have a date with this diplomat
I met while giving free massages...

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:27,785
...outside the U.N. And...
I don't know where his country is.

8
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,561
Okay, let's start with
the free massages at the U.N.

9
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,598
It's my new thing. I figure,
bodies at peace make peace.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,505
You might just get
the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

11
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,800
So, what country is this guy from?

12
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,635
There's a G in there.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,843
- Well, where's that?
- In your atlas.

14
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,880
I don't have an atlas.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,816
But, wait, I do have a globe.
Hold on.

16
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,488
So what's this guy like?

17
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,526
Well, he's very...

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,059
...dashing, you know?

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,024
And very, very sophisticated.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,858
And he doesn't speak any English...

21
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,296
...but according to his translator
he totally gets me.

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,299
Okay, here you go.

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,570
What is this?

24
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,801
It's a globe.

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,011
And a pencil sharpener.

26
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,742
People of Earth, surrender.

27
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,479
Giant alien.

28
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,748
Five tiny heads.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,093
Anybody need anything copied?
I'm going to the Xerox place.

30
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,264
No, thanks.

31
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,798
Okay, listen, just give me
anything I can make two of.

32
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,429
If you don't have anything to copy,
why go there?

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,003
Are you going down there to gawk at that
hot girl with the bellybutton ring again?

34
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,740
Yeah. You wanna come?

35
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,870
Yeah.

36
00:01:56,015 --> 00:02:00,816
The One Where Ross
and Rachel Take a Break

37
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,160
Come on, Chloe. Finish up
with your customer first.

38
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,200
Come on, Chloe.
Come on, Chloe!

39
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,563
Can I help you?

40
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,107
You know what?

41
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,141
We're having second thoughts
about our copying needs...

42
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,643
...and we'll need a little
more time to think about it.

43
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,448
Chloe, switch with me. There are
some guys here who got a crush on you.

44
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,178
Okay, that hurt us.

45
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,987
Hi, guys. I haven't seen
you since this morning.

46
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,290
Well...

47
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,219
You know.

48
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,401
Hey, what are you guys
doing tomorrow night?

49
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,830
Both of us?

50
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,734
Maybe. Does that scare you?

51
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,409
Relax.
Just Isaac's deejaying at The Philly.

52
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,410
- You should come.
- We'll be there.

53
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,107
Great. I'll see you then.

54
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,014
All right. Rock on.

55
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:59,462
He says that walking with you makes
this strange city feel like home.

56
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,036
Me too. Although
this city is my home, so...

57
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,212
So that's dumb, what I said.
Don't tell him I said that.

58
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,404
Just you make something up.

59
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,055
Nice. Thank you.

60
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,893
This is me, here.

61
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,867
Your eyes are very pretty.

62
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,107
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,279
Oh, thank you.

64
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,551
He would like to kiss you.

65
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,924
Okay. You know what,
you don't have to do that now.

66
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,099
No, no, not him!
No, you don't.

67
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,429
The moment's over.

68
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,721
See, there it is, right there.

69
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,982
Wow, it's small.

70
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,226
Yeah, but Sergei said
it took the Germans six weeks...

71
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,863
...to get all the way across it.

72
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,424
- So you had fun?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,000
Except for... You know
when you're on a date...

74
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,966
...and you're getting along great...

75
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,901
...but the guy's translator
keeps getting in the way?

76
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,973
No.

77
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,636
- Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,336
What, is Rach in her room?

79
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,982
No, she's still at work,
but she said to call her.

80
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,415
What? Is she gonna cancel
on me again? How could she do this?

81
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,349
Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?

82
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,322
All right, Ross. This is the extent
of my knowledge on the subject.

83
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,618
"Call Rachel."

84
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,126
What's that on the bottom?

85
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,232
That's my doodle of
a ladybug with a top hat.

86
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,635
She's fancy.

87
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,131
- Hello.
- Hey, honey.

88
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,536
- Hi.
- Hey, how's it going?

89
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,008
Well, kind of having
an underwear emergency.

90
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,240
Oh, yeah? What happened? Someone
scare you? Make you laugh too hard?

91
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,044
There was a disaster in shipping.
I have to get this order in.

92
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,654
Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like
I'm gonna be here all night.

93
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,624
What? Well, how about
I come up there?

94
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,660
No. No. No, honey, please. I've got...
I just have too much to deal with.

95
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,265
Anyway, I'm going out
with Sergei again tonight, and...

96
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,264
Could you be the translator's date...

97
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,803
...so that when it's time for our
alone time you two can split off?

98
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,772
You know, he's kind of cute.

99
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,276
Kind of cute like really kind of cute?
Or kind of cute like your friend...

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,504
...Spackle-Back Larry?

101
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,940
Hey, don't call him that.

102
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,277
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

103
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,582
You know, maybe we should get going.
What time did Chloe say to get there?

104
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,854
- 10:30.
- What time is it now?

105
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,862
4:30.

106
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,995
Yeah, so we'll hang out.

107
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,801
Hey, remember when she brought
up that thing about the three of us?

108
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,034
Yes, vividly.

109
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,679
- She was kidding about that, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

110
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,816
Yeah, I think so.

111
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,686
God, it'd be weird if that situation
presented itself tonight.

112
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,794
Yeah, I mean...

113
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,229
...what would we do?

114
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,264
Dude, I don't know.

115
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,365
- She was kidding.
- Yeah.

116
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,269
She was...

117
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,172
You know, just in case,
we should come up with ground rules.

118
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,278
Yeah. For sure. Okay.

119
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,245
Probably want the first one to be,
"Never open your eyes."

120
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,081
You know? Because you don't
want to be doing something...

121
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,224
...and then look up, right?

122
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,154
And see something that
you don't want to be seeing.

123
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,590
- You know?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,630
Good call. Nice.
Hold it! Hold it!

125
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,796
What if my eyes are closed, and...?

126
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,003
And my hand is out there...?

127
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,242
Okay, eyes open at all times.

128
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,843
How do we decide where we...

129
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,383
...you know, each would...

130
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,712
...you know...

131
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,622
...be?
- Right.

132
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,123
Right. Well, you know,
we could flip for it.

133
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,353
Yeah, I guess. But, like,
what's heads and what's tails?

134
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,496
Well, if you don't know that,
then I don't want to do this with you.

135
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,306
No, no, no.

136
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,443
I am looking at a purchase order right here,
and it clearly states that we ordered...

137
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:10,207
...the Riviera bikini in a variety
of sizes and colors and...

138
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,079
What does it matter what I'm wearing?

139
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,720
Could I please speak to your supervisor?
Thank you. We're holding.

140
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,824
- Hi.
- Oh, my God!

141
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,757
- What are you doing here?
- Well, you said you couldn't go out, so...

142
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,159
You brought a picnic.
What a boyfriend.

143
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,597
That's it. On Monday,
I start wearing makeup.

144
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,465
Ross, honey, this is very nice,
but I've got a crisis.

145
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,141
Yeah, but I've got couscous!

146
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,278
Honey, I'm sorry,
I know it's our anniversary...

147
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,812
...but I told you on the phone,
I don't have time to stop.

148
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,510
Okay, you don't have to stop.
I'm invisible. I'm not here.

149
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,312
Yeah, but I don't...

150
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,956
Who approved that order?

151
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,286
Well, there is no Mark Robinson
in this office.

152
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,789
- Get me Mark on the phone!
- I love Mark. Do you know Mark?

153
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,456
Yeah.

154
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,895
Let me just check that
with what I've got here.

155
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,594
All right. See, 038 is not the number
for this store. 038 is Atlanta.

156
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,907
Pepper?

157
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,438
- None for me.
- Okay, sorry...

158
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,443
I'm sorry. As I was saying,
the store number is wrong.

159
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,850
And I'm sorry, but that is...
Oh, my God!

160
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,128
Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'll have to call
you back. I've got Shemp in my office.

161
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,431
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

162
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,202
But, hey, somebody's off the phone.
How about a glass of wine...

163
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,277
...by the fire?
I can get it going again.

164
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,917
Ross, you're not listening to me.
I don't have time to stop.

165
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,019
- Come on, you don't have 10 minutes?
- I don't have 10 minutes!

166
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,884
- Sophie, does she have 10 minutes?
- Hey, Ross, I told you I don't!

167
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,787
Don't yell at me, okay? This is
the most I've seen you all week.

168
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,458
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay?

169
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,964
I've got a deadline. Would you
just go home. I'll talk to you later.

170
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,429
- Yeah, but wait...
- Goodbye!

171
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,171
Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

172
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,717
- Hey.
- Hi.

173
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,152
Look, about what happened earlier...

174
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,861
I completely understand.
You were stressed.

175
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,390
I was gonna give you a chance
to apologize to me.

176
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,603
For what? For letting you
throw me out of your office?

177
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,831
You had no right
coming down to my office, Ross.

178
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,807
You do not bring a picnic basket
to somebody's work...

179
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,980
...unless maybe they were
a park ranger.

180
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,010
Well, excuse me for wanting to be
with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

181
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,685
Boy, what an ass am I.

182
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,890
But I told you
I didn't have the time.

183
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,720
Yeah, well, you never have the time.

184
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,488
I don't feel like I even
have a girlfriend anymore.

185
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,823
What do you want from me?

186
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,229
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

187
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,166
No, but it would be nice
if you'd realize that it's just a job.

188
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,666
- Just a job?
- Yes.

189
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,870
Do you realize this is the first time in my
life I'm doing something I care about?

190
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,107
This is the first time I'm doing
something I'm actually good at?

191
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,885
I mean, if you don't get that...

192
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,520
I get that. I get that big-time,
and I'm happy for you.

193
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,486
I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

194
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,661
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I!

195
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,862
Is this about Mark?

196
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,662
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, it's not.

197
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:55,739
Oh, my God! I cannot keep having this
same fight over and over again, Ross.

198
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,501
- You're making this too hard.
- I'm making this too hard?

199
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,408
- Okay, what do you want me to do?
- I don't know. I don't know. Look...

200
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,048
...maybe we should take a break.

201
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,653
Okay. Okay, fine. You're right.
Let's take a break. Let's cool off. Okay.

202
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,982
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

203
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,426
No.

204
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,621
A break from us.

205
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,339
And the advances in collating
in the past five years...

206
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,573
I mean, we just got
in an X-5000, you know?

207
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,082
The X-5000 makes an X-50
look like a T-71.

208
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,548
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy!

209
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,724
- Hi, Ross!
- Hi, Chloe.

210
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,625
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

211
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,798
This guy's my hero.

212
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,196
He comes in with stuff,
he wants it blown up 400%.

213
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,531
We say, "We don't do that."
He says, "You gotta."

214
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,934
And you know what?
We did it.

215
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,942
And now anytime anybody wants
400, we just say, "Let's Ross it!"

216
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,910
And that's the only color
that comes in.

217
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,552
Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter
for the condom machine?

218
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,591
What are you doing here? I thought
tonight was your big anniversary dinner.

219
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:26,390
Yeah, a little change of plans.
We're gonna break up instead.

220
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,859
And I can also speak a little French.

221
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,899
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?

222
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,375
Why? What did I say?

223
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,339
Well, you just asked if I wanted
to go to bed with you tonight.

224
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,676
Oh, my God.

225
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,650
No wonder I get such
great service at Cafe Maurice.

226
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,318
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

227
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,459
Hi. Could you please tell Sergei
that I was fascinated...

228
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,494
...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali
said in the New York Times.

229
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,294
You didn't say
"Boutros Boutros-Ghali."

230
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,265
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

231
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,765
He says he was too.

232
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,967
Interesting.

233
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,307
So I was wondering...

234
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,211
Before you get all talky again...

235
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,886
...could you also please
tell Sergei...

236
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,823
...that I really like his suit.

237
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,100
He said, "Thank you."
He thinks you look pretty tonight.

238
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,902
"Your hair, golden like the sun."
So you're a chef?

239
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,875
I'm also thinking of opening up
my own restaurant.

240
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,549
- Really?
- Could I talk to you behind my menu?

241
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,920
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was having a conversation.

242
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,422
Mischa is so interested in you
that Sergei and I...

243
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,754
...haven't been able to say two words
to each other.

244
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,530
Do you want me to sit here silently
while you three converse?

245
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,428
That would be great.
Thank you.

246
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,869
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Mark.

247
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,913
- What? Is it my breath?
- No.

248
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,184
Sorry. I just thought
you were somebody else. Hi.

249
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,048
Hi. Look, I was just
gonna leave a message.

250
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,052
Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

251
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,088
Well...

252
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,620
- Rach? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

253
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,796
You wanna talk?
I can come over.

254
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,561
No. Really, no. Please. That's okay.

255
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,203
All right. I'm coming,
and I'll bring Chinese food.

256
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,896
Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry.

257
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,576
It's for me.

258
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,168
Okay, bye.

259
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,516
- So, what are you gonna do?
- What can I do?

260
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,811
One person wants to break up,
you break up.

261
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,420
No way. Come on. This is you guys.
Call her and work it out.

262
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,183
Come on. We just had this huge fight.
Don't I have to wait a while?

263
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,491
Hey, this isn't like swimming
after you eat. Pick up the phone!

264
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,637
You know that whole
swimming thing is a myth.

265
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,103
Yeah. Tell that to my uncle Lenny.

266
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,503
Why? What happened to him?

267
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,737
Nothing. He just really
believes in that.

268
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,518
And then we got into this
big, stupid fight... It was awful.

269
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:38,814
I told him he treats me like
a park ranger, something...

270
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,585
And then...

271
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,160
...I told him
I wanted to take a break.

272
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,261
I don't want to take a break.

273
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,990
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,300
- Egg roll?
- No.

275
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,000
And then I called him,
and he wasn't there.

276
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,801
Well, he's probably just out.

277
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,242
Well, thank you, that's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.

278
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,145
Hi, it's me.

279
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,024
- Hi. I'm so glad you called.
- Really?

280
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,524
I've been thinking this is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?

281
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,220
Hey, what do you wanna drink?

282
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,565
Who's that?

283
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,829
Nobody?

284
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,896
Is it okay if I finish
the apple juice?

285
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,633
Is that Mark?

286
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,841
- Honey, look, he just came over...
- Yeah, got it!

287
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,443
Hey, dinosaur guy.
Look at you, so sad.

288
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,713
- Come dance.
- That's okay. Thanks.

289
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,058
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.

290
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,025
I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?

291
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,132
Okay. Hey, two beers.

292
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,936
Okay, now we're
just dancing with each other.

293
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,740
And the vet said it was time.

294
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,949
And so from half a world away...

295
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,879
...while my mother
held the phone to his ear...

296
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,214
...I said goodbye to my dog...

297
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,749
...in seven languages.

298
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,989
- Could I have a tissue?
- Yeah, sure.

299
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,062
I just hope you don't accidentally...

300
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,167
...suck it up through your nose
and choke on it.

301
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,834
Sergei would like to apologize
for my behavior tonight.

302
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,573
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted."

303
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,479
He's unbelievable.

304
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,780
For the first time in three years,
someone wants to talk to me.

305
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,755
But do you think he would
let me enjoy that? No!

306
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,654
You silly diplomat. Why don't you
learn some English, Sergei.

307
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,363
Excuse me, but isn't he paying
for your dinner?

308
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,538
Hey, the man's dog just died.

309
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,447
I have just resigned my post.

310
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,286
Would you care to accompany
me to the Rainbow Room?

311
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,223
I have diplomatic coupons.

312
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,896
It would be my pleasure.

313
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,900
My guy has coupons.

314
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,200
Your guy can't even say "coupons."

315
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,177
- Plate.
- Plate! Yes! Plate!

316
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,483
Plate.

317
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,953
See, we don't need them.

318
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,527
- Plate?
- Yeah.

319
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,605
I like this song.

320
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,600
Well, you're practically
dancing already.

321
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,806
- Why don't you just do it over here?
- No.

322
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,143
What, are you married?

323
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,512
Because that's okay.

324
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,933
Be home, be home, be home,
be home, be home, be home.

325
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,830
Be home, be home, be home.

326
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,537
You're not home.

327
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,252
Still no smile?

328
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,090
American.

329
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,291
You know, it's a very hard language.

330
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,464
Let's do it again.
