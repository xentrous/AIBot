1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,920
Did we get paper towels?

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,040
You mean the thing
we went to the store for?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,600
Nope.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,120
Hey, I got you a present!

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,600
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,360
I ordered it for your wedding
and it's finally here!

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,000
You didn't have to get us anything..

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,920
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,360
-It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
-Oh, my God!

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,560
I didn't know where to put it.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,400
-We can put it in the guest bedroom.
-Yeah, okay.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,720
I kind of like it here.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,080
Do you like it?

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,040
I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,440
-This was my second favorite.
-What's your first?

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,040
-I don't remember the name.
-Well, what did it do?

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,200
You'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,560
A vending machine?

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,400
Don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm so glad you guys are here.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
Guess what happened
in the paleontology department.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,080
Professor Newman, the department head,
is retiring, so..

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,160
-They made you head of the department!
-I'm teaching his advanced class!

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,640
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Great. You've always wanted
to teach an advanced class.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,400
No, I know. It's really exciting.
This is the break I've been waiting for.

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm not sure a court-ordered
detox program..

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
was the break
Professor Newman was waiting for.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
But, hey.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,720
Hey, Rach, I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,840
Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
Great, thanks.

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,840
Then take her to the
Four Seasons for drinks.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,640
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,320
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,960
You sure are naming
a lot of ways to postpone sex.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,000
I miss dating. Dressing up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,920
I won't be able to do that for so long.
And it's so much fun.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,600
Not that sitting around
worrying about giving birth isn't fun.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,560
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,680
You don't want to date
a pregnant lady.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes, I do. We're gonna
have a good time.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,080
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections..

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,480
and baby heads stretching out..

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240
Okay, I'll go with you.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,800
-It will be fun.
-All right.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
No, no! Yes!

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
Would you look at that.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,040
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,480
Okay, I'm next.

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,880
Don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,920
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,640
-Phoebe's hogging the game.
-It's a stupid game.

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,680
You think it's stupid because
you suck.

56
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,680
I don't suck. It sucks.

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,080
You suck.

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,120
If this game is gonna cause problems,
I should keep it.

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,080
No, I love it. It is a great present.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,200
Why don't you go home and wait
for the thank-you card?

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,480
-Why do you want to play this game?
-It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,200
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair.

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,840
Phoebe!
Chandler!

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,760
No, no. This is a girl fight.
I'm hoping it will turn into love-play.

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,600
Okay, look.
Honey, I'm sorry..

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm acting hostile. I don't mean to.
It's just that I love this game so much..

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,080
that I would just like
the chance to play it too.

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
Wow, it's amazing how well I can play
with you yapping around my head..

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
like a Chihuahua.

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,200
All right, that's it. Chandler,
help me get her out of the chair.

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,040
Chandler, come on.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
Joey, could you get that?

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,840
Joey.

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,840
I thought you were in your room.

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm picking you up for our date.
For you.

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,200
Lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,320
And a brownie.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,640
Well, half a brownie.

79
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,880
Actually, it's just a bag.

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,680
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I felt faint, so..

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
This is so great! I actually feel
like I'm on a real date.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,920
But I have morning sickness and
I have on underwear that goes up to..

83
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
there.

84
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,400
Hey, come on. This is a real date.

85
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,000
So nice place you got here.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,120
Football. Pizza box.

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
My kind of woman.

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,240
That's my roommate's.

89
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,080
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

90
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,280
He's protective of me,
so you'd better watch yourself.

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,240
Your roommate, is he good-looking?

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Must be tough to keep your hands
off him.

93
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm pretty sure he's gay.

94
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,520
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,840
Which brings us back
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,920
That's it for today.

97
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,440
Does anyone know where
the Freeman Building is?

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,840
It's the new building on Avenue A.

99
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,920
That's across town.
I'm teaching there in 10 minutes.

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,200
Dude, that's not gonna happen.

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,880
Move it! Move it!

102
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,480
Hey! I'm the teacher!

103
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,160
Hello.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,200
Sorry I'm a little late.
Whoa, a lot late.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, let me start
by introducing myself.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm Professor Geller.

107
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,800
So to sum up..

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.

109
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,200
-What comes with the filet mignon?
-Steamed vegetables.

110
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,120
Instead of the vegetables..

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,440
is there any way that I could
substitute the..

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,680
three-pound lobster?

113
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,320
You know what? Bring her both.

114
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
And I'll have the same.

115
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

116
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,360
No roommate stuff. It's a date.

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,000
Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,440
Have any moves?

120
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,880
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for..

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,480
I knew it. Tell me your moves.

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,200
All right.

124
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
Well..

125
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,440
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,960
Oh, my God. And that works?

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,280
If you add, "This is embarrassing.
I just want to have a normal life."

128
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,880
You poor little famous man.

129
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,600
Okay, how about this one?

130
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,360
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you..

131
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,000
but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

132
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Oh, my God!

133
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,280
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. Really.

134
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,520
So tell me one of your moves.

135
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,640
All right.

136
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,800
So where'd you grow up?

137
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,120
That's your move?

138
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,080
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

139
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,080
-Come on, just answer the question.
-Queens.

140
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,560
Were you close to your parents?

141
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,880
-With my mom. Not so much my dad.
-Why not?

142
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know.
There's just this distance.

143
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,640
We both try to pretend it's not there,
but it is.

144
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
It's gotta be rough.

145
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,720
Yeah, it's really tough.
Sometimes I think..

146
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,680
Wow!

147
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Nice move!

148
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,400
-"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
-Thank you.

149
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,520
Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna use the restroom.

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,400
-Now you're watching me walk away.
-Yes, I am! So simple!

151
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,120
-You won't believe what I did today.
-Clearly not shower or shave.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,520
I played this all day,
and now I rule.

153
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,000
They should change the name
to "Ms. Chandler."

154
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,920
Although, I hope they don't.

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,240
You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went to work like a chump?

156
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
I got the top 10 scores. I erased
Phoebe off the board. High-five!

157
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,320
What is the matter with your hand?

158
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,040
I played for eight hours.

159
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.

160
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,480
Also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

161
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,760
-Chandler, why would you do that?
-Because it's awesome.

162
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480
You think it's clever?

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,640
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

164
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,720
But clearly you're up to the task.

165
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,880
-This one's not dirty.
-Put it together with that one.

166
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,280
Oh.

167
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,240
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

168
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,400
Ben's coming over tomorrow.
This can't be there.

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,320
-He won't know what they mean.
-He's 7, not stupid.

170
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
-Have you talked to him lately?
-I'm gonna unplug it.

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,440
I'll have nothing to show for my day.
Like work.

172
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
No!

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,280
Hey, look! It's still there!

174
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,120
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip!

175
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,800
Wow. The dirty words
and the computer talk.

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,760
This is just the coolest
you've ever been.

177
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,160
-You gotta beat your scores.
-With the claw?

178
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,680
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off.

179
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

180
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

181
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,280
-I am not gonna answer that.
-Oh, come on. Just pick one.

182
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,880
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross..

183
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,520
if you had to,
who would you punch?

184
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,200
We're friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,280
Chandler?

186
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,160
Yeah, but I don't know why.

187
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,320
-I'm having a wonderful time!
-Me too!

188
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,240
-This is the best date I ever had.
-I know!

189
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,920
I laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

190
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Joey, I think everybody saw it.

191
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,240
I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

192
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,080
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

193
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
All right. Now don't judge me.

194
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,040
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but I'm ripping into the swan.

195
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,880
Okay, then you don't judge me.

196
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from that brownie.

197
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,600
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

199
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,520
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me..

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,000
first, I make my lips
look irresistible.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,400
How do you do it?

202
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,360
Now you can't tell anyone, but..

203
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,920
I put on shiny lip balm.

204
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,440
-Oh, my God.
-Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.

205
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,200
-Okay, now you go.
-No, I don't want to tell you.

206
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
-Why not?
-It's embarrassing.

207
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,040
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

208
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,600
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,160
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.

210
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Okay.

211
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
All right, stand up.

212
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,200
Well, when we're at the door..

213
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,080
I lightly press my lips
against his.

214
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

215
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,920
And then I make this sound:

216
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,280
It doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

217
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

218
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,080
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

219
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,840
Me too.

220
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,080
You were 50 minutes late?
Did you crawl?

221
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,000
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

222
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,280
When did people stop understanding
"Get out of my way"?

223
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,760
Why didn't you take a cab?

224
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,680
With the traffic and one-way streets,
it'd take me twice as long.

225
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,480
And I have class three times a week.
Who am I, Rockefeller?

226
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,560
You won't be able to keep doing this.

227
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,320
If I don't, they'll take the class
away from me.

228
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,440
And I put it in my family newsletter.

229
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
-Your what?
-You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

230
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,120
Right. Wow.

231
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,280
I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

232
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,480
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

233
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,200
-Hey.
-Hi!

234
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Remember when we talked about Cujo?

235
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,720
I can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.

236
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,840
Relax, it isn't Citizen Kane.

237
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,080
Have you ever sat through
Citizen Kane?

238
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah, it's really boring.
But it's, like, a big deal.

239
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo.

240
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,160
Well, let's do it tonight.

241
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
-Don't you have that big date?
-Oh, right.

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,280
-Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

243
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,240
After our date, did you feel weird?

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

245
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't know. I'm kind of thinking
it was the lobster.

246
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

247
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,680
-I was up sick all night.
-Me too. All night.

248
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,480
Really? We didn't cross paths.

249
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Yeah, well, that's because..

250
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,080
I stayed in my room.

251
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
You don't want to look
in my hamper.

252
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
Okay, I got that.

253
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

254
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,480
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

255
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, you're just a little bitch,
aren't you?!

256
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,600
Hey, you guys?

257
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

258
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,360
But if you don't get off soon,
I will cut you.

259
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Oh, my God! Your friends have
some unfortunate initials.

260
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
They're all Chandler.

261
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,320
Chandler couldn't get this good.

262
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,160
I did. But it came at a price.

263
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,360
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

264
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,880
By age 7, kids have
already seen orgies.

265
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Was it just me?

266
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
So..

267
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,840
we're about out of time.

268
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,280
Now, I know I've given
you a lot of new information.

269
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,040
And it may seem
a little overwhelming.

270
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,880
But, if there's one thing..

271
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,240
you need to take away
from class today..

272
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
it's that..

273
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,320
dinosaurs ain't never coming back.

274
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,240
I'll see you next time.

275
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,320
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

276
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Okay, why don't we all..

277
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,320
open our books to page 23..

278
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,960
where..

279
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
where you will see..

280
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,840
a bunch of red spots.

281
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay, why don't you all start to read
while I..

282
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
This is so embarrassing.

283
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,520
I just want to have a normal life.

284
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,480
Wow, that's an expensive
bottle of wine.

285
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,520
It is?

286
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
That's funny, my fans
don't normally do that.

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,400
Are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,920
No, no, I'm fine. It's just..

289
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,080
Hey, can I ask you something?

290
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,040
Have you ever looked at someone
you know..

291
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,680
and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

292
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,840
You mean like from behind?

293
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,440
Yeah. That's exactly it.

294
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,760
I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,560
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

296
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
Yeah.

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,480
So you know exactly what I mean.

298
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,840
Totally! Wow.

299
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
-Would you excuse me?
-Sure.

300
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,720
-Phoebe! You're on fire!
-I know!

301
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
You can do it!

302
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

303
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,720
Go left! Go right! Go right!

304
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
I can't! I can't!

305
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,800
No! You son of a..

306
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
Phoebe?!

307
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,080
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

308
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,480
Thank God you're home!
I'm watching Cujo.

309
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
-Alone?
-Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

310
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,280
Did you get to the part where Cujo
throws himself at the car?

311
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,240
No, seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

312
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,840
Wait, what happened to your date?

313
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
Oh, it didn't work out.

314
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,040
-Want to watch the rest of the movie?
-Oh, okay. Yeah.

315
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
I never thought I'd say this..

316
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,920
but I hope this dog dies.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
What are you doing?
Sit here. Protect me.

318
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

319
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,520
Okay.

320
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,800
-That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
-I know.

321
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,280
It's gonna be okay.

322
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,600
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

323
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,680
How can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

324
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,320
Terrified.

325
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

326
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,840
Let us begin.

327
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

328
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,680
Here..

329
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,680
and..

330
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
here.

331
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,120
Now, as for the hydrosaurs..
