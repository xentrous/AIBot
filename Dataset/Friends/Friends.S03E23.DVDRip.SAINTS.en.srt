1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,234
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a baby?

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,566
We could call it Chuck.

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,308
Or Dick.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,575
Listen, I need a favor.

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,453
I was in the shower,
and as I was...

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,215
...cleansing myself, I felt something.

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,459
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,521
No. I mean, like,
a thing on my body.

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,598
- Well, what was it?
- Well, I don't know.

11
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,635
It's kind of in a place that's not...

12
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,898
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys...

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,972
...could help me out.

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,340
Come on, you guys!
It's no big deal!

15
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,382
Well, what is it?
Is it a mole?

16
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,752
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,858
Is it...?
What, a pimple?

18
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,823
No, it's...

19
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,025
...fancier than a pimple.

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,695
- Ross, just go see a doc...
- Guys, what's...?

21
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,011
Well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

22
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,908
Yeah, right.

23
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:30,821
The One With Ross's Thing

24
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,162
And this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

25
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,337
- Good deal.
- These are my friends.

26
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,732
People? This is Vince.
Vince, the people.

27
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,109
Vince is a fireman.

28
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,014
Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building?

29
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,479
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,777
If Joey and I play with matches,
we could get you up to an even 100.

31
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,119
Fire safety is not a joke, son.

32
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,254
You're right. I know.

33
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,466
Look, I gotta go.
I'm on call tonight.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,931
- See you Saturday.
- Okay.

35
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,538
He's cute, Pheebs.

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,571
But you just started dating
that teacher.

37
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,800
Oh, Jason?
We're seeing each other tonight.

38
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,739
Well, Pheebs?

39
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,083
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

40
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,082
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field.

41
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,221
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats.

42
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,787
You know, this kind of, like,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

43
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,326
So do they know about each other?

44
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,289
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

45
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,503
Okay, no, they don't know.

46
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,837
Hey, guys.

47
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,240
- Well?
- How'd it go at the doctor's?

48
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,215
He said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's benign.

49
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,748
- What is it?
- He couldn't even tell me.

50
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:48,553
He said it was just
some sort of skin abnormality.

51
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,323
- So it's just skin.
- Well, no. He said it's skinlike.

52
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,867
- Okay. So it's not skin.
- Well, it's in the skin family.

53
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,335
The worst thing is, he said,
being unable to identify it...

54
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,304
...he was reluctant to remove it.

55
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,033
You should go to my guy.

56
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,907
'Cause when I went in there
with my third nipple...

57
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,076
...he just lopped it right off.

58
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,081
So I guess I'm lucky.

59
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,780
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

60
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:22,585
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

61
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,889
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

62
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,693
You know?
They'd call it "The Ross."

63
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,667
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross."

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,708
Yeah, that'd be cool.

65
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,771
Pete's breaking up with me.

66
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,503
What?

67
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,409
I just checked my messages.

68
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,950
He said that when he gets back,
"We need to talk."

69
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,845
- And?
- Well, that's it.

70
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,419
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

71
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,492
That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

72
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,331
- Really?
- Maybe he just cheated on you.

73
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,439
I won't get rich doing it,
but I gotta say, it's cool...

74
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,235
...knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

75
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,935
That is so great.

76
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,475
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,945
Oh, my God!

78
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,142
- We'd better call the fire department.
- No! No!

79
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,345
- No. No.
- Well, we don't need a fireman.

80
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,684
We need, like, a good mechanic.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,187
- What?
- It's probably just low on coolant.

82
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,424
Oh, my God! Here they come!
We gotta get out of here!

83
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,862
Wait. Why?

84
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,835
If I wanted to see a fireman,
I'd date one.

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,441
That's all it is.
A third nipple.

86
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,237
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,916
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

88
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,278
Take your shirt off.
Let's see what we're dealing with.

89
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,547
What are you doing?

90
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,985
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

91
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,788
Well, that's not a third nipple.

92
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,467
First of all, it's on your ass.

93
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,868
Well, then, what is it?

94
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,268
Wait a minute. Hold it.

95
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,375
- Jansen, come in here.
- I'm with Hamilton.

96
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,979
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

97
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,584
You know what you don't see a lot?
Topless tap dancing.

98
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,419
I really enjoy these little talks
we have.

99
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,389
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

100
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,899
You know what? If he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water them.

101
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,937
If he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should do it...

102
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,902
...if you know what I mean.

103
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,844
Or...

104
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,878
...we could go and pee on them.

105
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,778
I can't take it, you know.

106
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,923
I'm afraid one of them
will catch me with the other.

107
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,656
It's making me crazy!

108
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,859
Why don't you break up
with one of them?

109
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,694
What happened to playing the field?

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,059
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

111
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,261
It feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

112
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,840
So pick one of them.

113
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,166
Which one do you like more?

114
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,812
Vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

115
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,848
He's just so burly,
so very burly.

116
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,415
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with Vince.

117
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,487
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.

118
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,623
Sensitive is important.
Pick him.

119
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,688
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.

120
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,291
Jason is not a sissy.

121
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,526
No. No. I meant Chandler.

122
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,309
You know, I have dinner plans.

123
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,077
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

124
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:14,325
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years...

125
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,925
...and I'm stumped.

126
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,704
Okay, this is the den.

127
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,240
All right, check this out.
Lights!

128
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,977
All right, less lights!
Bad lights!

129
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,410
Lights, go away!

130
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,219
See? You just need the right command.

131
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,219
Yes. And the dimmer switch.

132
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,520
For a rich guy, that's a small TV.

133
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,218
That's the videophone.

134
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,329
But you're not supposed to be here,
so don't touch anything!

135
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,698
IKEA, this is comfortable.

136
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,865
This place is amazing.

137
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,836
- Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.
- I know.

138
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,304
It's the nicest kitchen.

139
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,944
The refrigerator
told me to have a great day.

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,580
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

141
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,148
Joey, put that down.

142
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,878
Oh, my God, that's Pete.
Get out!

143
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,250
How the hell do you answer
a videophone?

144
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,948
Monica?

145
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,461
I guess that's how.

146
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,659
Monica, how's it going?

147
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,198
Oh, it's good. It's good.

148
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,164
Just here, watering the plants.

149
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,531
Don't forget that ficus
there by Rachel.

150
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,640
Chandler's on the couch!

151
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,307
I see him. You guys
are the worst hiders, ever.

152
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,278
- Hi.
- How you doing?

153
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,343
Pete, the other day when you said
you needed to talk...

154
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:53,184
...just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

155
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,792
It's good news.
It's definitely good news.

156
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,695
Hold on a second,
I have another call.

157
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,058
- How's it going?
- It's still me.

158
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,232
No. I've got picture-in-picture here.

159
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,704
Yeah. Okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

160
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,038
Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

161
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,213
Okay. So I'll see you soon.

162
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,345
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you.

163
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,847
We love you too!

164
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,622
Well, it's good news.
It's good news.

165
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,984
- What do you think the good news is?
- Look at this!

166
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,492
He wrote a check for $50,000
to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design."

167
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,067
Sorry. What do you think
the good news is?

168
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,629
Oh, my!

169
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,770
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

170
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,706
You gotta get Mom on the phone!
Call Mom! Call Mom!

171
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,176
And that's Pete's mom.

172
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,726
You have to make it a theme wedding.
And the theme could be:

173
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,529
"Look how much money we've got!"

174
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,630
I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

175
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,529
You could have, like,
little money place settings.

176
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,330
And you could start
with a money salad.

177
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:19,099
I mean, it'll be dry,
but people will like it.

178
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,143
Would you stop?
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

179
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,043
We don't know if he'll propose.

180
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,682
But this is Pete.
He's not like other people.

181
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,683
On your first date, you went to Rome.

182
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,822
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

183
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,754
Well, if that's what it is,
then it's crazy.

184
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,059
Monica's right.
We're talking about marriage here.

185
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,766
She can't just rush into this.

186
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,766
What do you know?
You married a lesbian!

187
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,544
You could do worse Monica.
He's a really good guy.

188
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,542
You know what you should do?
Don't decide now.

189
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,277
Wait until you're in the moment and
whatever you feel will be the answer.

190
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:06,322
Pete gets down on his knee and pulls
out that pumpkin-sized diamond ring...

191
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
I gotta go.
I have to break up with Vince.

192
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,031
- You're going with the teacher?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,793
I like Vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive.

194
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,836
In the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having...

195
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,702
...a really, really, really nice body.

196
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,575
Jason. Definitely Jason.

197
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,809
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

198
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,615
Oh, my God!

199
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,791
Sorry. I was imagining what it'd be
like to catch the money bouquet.

200
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,927
Excuse me. Is Vince here?

201
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,800
Oh, sure. Vince!

202
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,844
Wow. I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

203
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,078
So, what's up?

204
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:09,078
Wow. This isn't gonna be easy.

205
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,325
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

206
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,489
Good deal.

207
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,956
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

208
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,063
It's just that I thought
we had something pretty special here.

209
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,399
I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

210
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,942
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

211
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,872
My God!
I didn't know you were so...

212
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,079
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

213
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,280
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

214
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,119
Wait! Wait! Wait!

215
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,362
If you wanna take care of that thing,
go see my herbal guy.

216
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,166
Thank you. But I wanna remove it,
I don't want to make it savory.

217
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,301
When girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body...

218
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,634
...they tell their friends about it.

219
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,676
Give me that.

220
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,547
Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

221
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,118
- Brides' magazines?
- Yes.

222
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,018
I know you said you'd say no
if he asked you but I'm sorry...

223
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:24,561
...how great would you look walking
down the aisle in this Donna Karan?

224
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,322
You so would!

225
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,300
You should get that anyway.

226
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,069
Well, for clubbing.

227
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,668
It is so weird.

228
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,877
I know what I said.
But this morning...

229
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,443
...I was lying in bed, imagining
what it would be like to say yes.

230
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,585
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed...

231
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,322
...and it's not like me to do
something like this.

232
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,625
But it doesn't mean I can't.
Right?

233
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,589
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

234
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,627
And I know that
we want the same things.

235
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,163
And when I thought
about saying yes...

236
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,992
...it made me really happy.

237
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,700
Oh, my God!

238
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,734
I know.

239
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,540
I need more pie.

240
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,372
Mon, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

241
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:24,222
- You didn't break up with that fireman?
- No. That was my way of telling you.

242
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,959
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

243
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,184
He keeps a journal and he paints.

244
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,456
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

245
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:38,032
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has
easy access to a lot of charcoal.

246
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,531
So then, are you gonna dump Jason?

247
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,869
Yeah, because I have to break up
with someone.

248
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,070
So Jason is sensitive.
But now so is Vince.

249
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,442
Plus, Vince has the body.
You know?

250
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,877
So...

251
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,552
It's really just about the math.

252
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,731
- Jason?
- Come on in.

253
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,169
You sounded serious on the phone.

254
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,273
Is anything wrong?

255
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,820
You must be Ross.

256
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,463
- Hi.
- I am Guru Saj.

257
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:51,073
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so...

258
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,038
Well, relax. If it makes you feel
any better, I've attended...

259
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,577
...fine medical schools
in Central America.

260
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,649
Well, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

261
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,581
Come on, have a seat.

262
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,587
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

263
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,326
What's a "kundus"?

264
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,831
I don't know.
What's a kundus with you?

265
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,806
Please lie down.

266
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,570
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,711
I guess it's worth a try.

268
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,438
Sure. We should see results...

269
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,483
Clearly not the way to go!

270
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,386
What? What?

271
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,850
We appear to have angered it.

272
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,224
We? We angered it?

273
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,554
I think I see the problem.

274
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,795
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

275
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,096
- Love.
- Oh, God!

276
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,773
Often these things are nothing more
than negative energy...

277
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,502
...trying to escape your body.

278
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,945
Now. This is not gonna come off unless
you learn to love it, my friend.

279
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:10,087
So let me hear you say,
you will love the kundus.

280
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,151
I love the kundus.

281
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,588
There is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off...

282
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,732
...unless you start to...

283
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,334
What was that?

284
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,662
Well, it's gone.

285
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,736
- How's that?
- Got caught in my watch.

286
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,873
Lights.

287
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,411
Romantic lights.

288
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,785
Nice.

289
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,288
So there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

290
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,422
Oh, right. I completely forgot
about that.

291
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,530
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

292
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,198
- And I look at my life...
- Yeah.

293
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,704
...and I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

294
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,645
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

295
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,080
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

296
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,081
- Wow.
- But there's one thing missing.

297
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,718
What's that?

298
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,295
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

299
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,494
Okay.

300
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,966
Monica, I wanna become...

301
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,071
...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

302
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,673
You wanna what?

303
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,971
I wanna become
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

304
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,011
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

305
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,649
It's banned in 49 states.

306
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,047
What are you talking about?

307
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,878
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...

308
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,717
...a combination of Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian streetfighting.

309
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,154
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

310
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,398
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

311
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,495
Yeah.

312
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,535
Monica, I want you there
in the front row when I win.

313
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,240
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

314
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,572
What do you think?

315
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,372
My parents will be so happy.

316
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,621
Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt

317
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,157
Crazy underwear
Always in a rut

318
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,492
Crazy underwear

319
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,692
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

320
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,938
All right, just keep playing.
Keep playing.

321
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,765
You'll get through this.
You'll be fine.

322
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,210
Okay, thank you.

323
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,916
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

324
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,153
Hey. I was just passing by
and saw you were playing tonight.

325
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,729
It's kind of cool, seeing you up there.

326
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,097
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?

327
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,631
I don't know! He just started
kissing me. Get him, Vince!

328
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,943
- What?
- What?

329
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,411
Okay. I've been dating both of you.

330
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,878
And it's been really horrible
because it's been...

331
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,020
...a lot of fun for me.

332
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,096
But I like you both...

333
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,558
...and I didn't know how to choose.

334
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,665
So I'm sorry. I'm just terrible.
I'm a terrible person.

335
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,303
Phoebe, relax. It's okay.
I mean...

336
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,905
We never said this was exclusive.

337
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,803
Neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

338
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,972
- Really?
- Yeah.

339
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,309
We haven't been going out that long.

340
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,245
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet.

341
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,487
You haven't?

342
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,557
- You have?
- Well, this is none of my business.

343
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,492
I can't believe this!
You slept with him?

344
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,632
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

345
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,774
You know, Phoebe.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

346
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,846
Well, that could have been
really awkward.

347
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,149
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

348
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,825
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

349
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,528
I can't believe
I ever went out with somebody...

350
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,356
...who would actually have an open
flame in the middle of a wooded area!

351
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,444
Everything's gonna be all right.

352
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,104
Okay, Dick?

353
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,018
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

354
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,990
He's supposed to be a duck, right?
Because otherwise...

355
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,217
...this is way out of my league.

356
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:21,160
Yeah. He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet can't do anything about it.

357
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,129
Is there something you can do?

358
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:27,504
Let me see. Let me see.

359
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,906
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?
