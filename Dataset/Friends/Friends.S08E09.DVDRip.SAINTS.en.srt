1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,800
Did you know that during pregnancy..

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,080
your fingers swell up to twice
their size and never go back?

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
Oh, my God! Let me see that.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,920
You fall for it every time.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,640
Hey! I brought you
my old maternity clothes.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,600
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute!

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,840
Look. See how they expand
as the baby grows?

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,120
And after the baby's born
they're great for shoplifting melons.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,280
Good, you're all here.
Thanksgiving, 4:00.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,720
Guess who I invited? Remember
Will Culvert from high school?

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,480
-No.
-He was in Ross' class.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,160
Marching band, was kind of overweight.
Really overweight.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
I was his thin friend.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,280
I don't remember. Are you talking
about your imaginary boyfriend?

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,320
No, that was Jared.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,120
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,560
Will's here on business, and he didn't have
a place to go, so I invited him here.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,960
-That's nice.
-Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,520
He looks good.
Okay, I mean really gorgeous.

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,320
-I still love Chandler.
-Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,080
Just so you know,
I'm not gonna make a turkey this year..

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,880
-What?
-Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,320
-Phoebe! -Turkeys are
beautiful, intelligent animals.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,400
No, they're not! They're ugly
and stupid and delicious!

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Plus, eating them is like a tradition.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,200
It goes back to the first Thanksgiving when
the Indians sat down with the cowboys.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Oh, right. That's when they had
that big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,320
It's not just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet,
Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food..

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
-Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
-She is?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Yeah. Remember? I had to leave
the other day when you had that chicken.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,560
I thought that was
because I put the whole thing..

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
on my hand
and made it walk across the table.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,760
It's not worth it to make a whole turkey
for just three people. It's a lot of work.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,320
But you gotta have turkey
on Thanksgiving!

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,080
Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
Fourth of July with no apple pie.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,360
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
Fine, if it means that much to you.
But there's gonna be a ton left over.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,440
No. I promise I will finish that turkey.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,400
You're telling me you can eat
almost an entire turkey in one sitting?

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,320
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
This is what we do.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,360
We may not be great
thinkers or world leaders..

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,120
we don't read a lot or run fast,
but damn it, we can eat!

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Four wide receivers. On third and 18.

44
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,840
Isn't it weird how next year
there will be a baby at the table?

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Rachel's. But good to know
where you're at.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,240
-Hey!
-Hey!

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,320
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too!

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,360
-Can I help?
-Yes.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,520
Chandler usually helps,
but he's into the game.

50
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,520
Could you fold these napkins? I'm gonna
go across the hall to check on the yams.

51
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
No, sweetie. No, not like that.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,560
We're not at a barn dance.

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,280
Fold them like swans.
I showed you at Christmas. Remember?

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,880
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,680
-So how's the game?
-I have no idea.

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,080
-What?
-I'm pretending to watch..

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,360
so I don't have to help out.

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,080
I don't believe you!
That is brilliant!

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
-And Monica has no idea?
-No.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Once in a while,
I just yell stuff at the TV.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Hey! What? Aw! Hey!

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,560
-Your team winning?
-Anderson just scored again.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,480
There is no Anderson.

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,720
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,080
I can't help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.

66
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,080
-You like football?
-Normally, I don't.

67
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,040
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,680
-You like Green Bay?
-It's only my favorite bay.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,720
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Will, I'm so glad that you came.

70
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,720
You look great. You must've lost..

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,440
150 pounds. I'll be on one of those
Subway commercials.

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,560
-A pie!
-It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
-It's no good. Throw it out.
-Meet some people.

74
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,240
This is my husband, Chandler.
This is Will.

75
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,040
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand
but I'm really into the game.

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,760
Plus, it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand next to each other.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,200
-This is Phoebe.
-Hi.

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,360
Hey. Wow!

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,680
Well done.

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,880
-Wanna give me a hand?
-I can't get over how great you look.

81
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,560
-You look incredible too. You're so fit.
-I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.

82
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,600
-I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
-Great, I love Ross.

83
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Good. And Rachel Greene too.

84
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,080
-Is there a problem?
-No. It's okay.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,080
It's just.. God, I hated her.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
-What?
-I hated her.

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,480
She was horrible to me in high school.

88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,360
But hey, that was a long time ago. I'm in
a good place. Might be fun to see her again.

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,960
Got any cakes or cookies
or something?

90
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,200
No, Will! No!

91
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,880
It's been a while since we screamed.
Maybe we should.

92
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,000
-Oh, okay. No!
-Come on!

93
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,600
What are you doing?
You've got an entire turkey to eat.

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,280
Let me explain to you how
the human body works.

96
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,160
I have to warm up my stomach first.

97
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,880
-Eating chips is like stretching.
-Okay.

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,760
-Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
-I'm here to tell you something.

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,120
You can eat and eat, but nothing
will ever fill that void.

100
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,840
-Who the hell is this guy?
-This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.

101
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,920
-Want some chips?
-No.

102
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,360
-Will!
-Ross!

103
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,240
Hey, you came!
Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,480
-Hot stuff?
-It's good to see you, man.

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,680
-I'm a commodities broker.
-That sounds interesting.

107
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
-Yeah, it's not.
-Oh.

108
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,560
-But I'm rich and thin.
-Oh.

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,280
I haven't seen you since
Lance Davis' graduation party.

110
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,200
That was such a fun night.

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,440
Would've been good if we had
gotten in, but still fun.

112
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,120
We were lame. Do you remember
how into dinosaurs we were?

113
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,560
-Yeah.
-So, what do you do now?

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,760
So how long are you in town?

115
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,320
-Hi.
-Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

116
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,960
Rachel Greene.

117
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,240
Oh, that's right.
Are you gonna be okay?

118
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,320
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just..
God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!

119
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,480
High school was a long time ago.

120
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,640
Look at her standing there
with those yams.

121
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,200
My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greene
and complex carbohydrates.

122
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,360
Oh, my God. Who is that?

123
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,640
-That's Will, from high school.
-Oh! I do not remember him.

124
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,120
Wow, really got that sexy
smoldering thing going on.

125
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,480
He's trying to mouth something to me.

127
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,240
I hate you!

128
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
-Okay, dinner's ready!
-Okay!

129
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,480
-Solid effort. Solid effort.
-Oh, so who won?

130
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,920
-Green Bay.
-Detroit.

131
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
-What?
-The Lions technically won.

132
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,520
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,400
Hi! Will, right?
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,480
-Oh, I remember you.
-Really? Aren't you sweet?

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,640
I gotta tell you, I'm having
the hardest time placing you.

136
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,160
Hang on! I think I remember you.

137
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,640
Did we fool around at
Lance Davis' graduation party?

138
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,400
-You are unbelievable.
-Thank you.

139
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Rachel? Why don't you sit here?
And Will, you sit way over there.

140
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,280
That's it? Even if nobody helps me,
I can eat that. No problem.

141
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,560
-At least give me a challenge.
-This is Chandler's chicken.

142
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
This is the turkey.

143
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Oh. How big is that?

144
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,520
-About 19 pounds.
-It's like me when I was born.

145
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,400
-Who would like some yams? Will?
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,800
What? Oh, can we please keep
the chicken..

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,440
and the turkey on the other side?

148
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
-The smell is just..
-Typical.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
-What?
-I said it was typical.

150
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,360
Typical of you. Queen Rachel does
whatever she wants in Rachel-land.

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Seriously, who is this guy?

152
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,360
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?

153
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,400
-I don't know. Do I? Do I?
-I think you do.

154
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,560
You were a little mean
to him in high school.

155
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,280
-A little mean? You made my life miserable.
-I had no idea. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,040
Well, you should be.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.

157
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,960
But you worked so hard.

158
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,520
-Yams!
-Okay.

159
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm real sorry for whatever
I did to you in high school.

160
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,520
It wasn't just me. We had a club.

161
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,440
-You had a club?
-The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!

162
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,160
So you all just joined together
to hate me?

163
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,480
-Who else was in this club?
-Me and Ross.

164
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,520
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.

165
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,680
-You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
-Yes, he was.

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,080
No, no.

167
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,360
-So who else was in this club?
-That exchange student from Thailand.

168
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,560
But I don't think he knew what it was.

169
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,000
You guys were cool.

170
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,520
So, Ross, we went out for two years..

171
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,400
and you never told me you were
in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?

172
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,880
You went out with her? We had a pact.

173
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,920
-It's not like it was binding forever.
-It had the word "eternity" in it.

174
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm thinking of joining
an "I Hate Turkey Club."

175
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,720
Although, I do love a turkey club.

176
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,320
Monica? Did you know about this?

177
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,520
I didn't. Is that why
you used to lock the bedroom door?

178
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,080
-Yeah.
-A little relieved, I gotta say.

179
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,320
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?

180
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,880
-The only reason I joined..
-Cofounded.

181
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
Cofounded.

182
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,640
Cofounded the club,
was that I was in love with you.

183
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,720
I didn't handle it very well. If you think
about it, the "I Hate Rachel Club"..

184
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,800
was really
the "I Love Rachel Club."

185
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Except that it was really
the "I Hate Rachel Club."

186
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,400
So you'd get together
and say mean things about me?

187
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,760
-We did a little more than that.
-No, no, no.

188
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
What else did you do?

189
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,800
-We started a rumor.
-What rumor?

190
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,880
Come on, Will,
just take off your shirt and tell us.

191
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,600
-Ross?
-It was no big deal.

192
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,360
We said that.. The rumor was that..

193
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,760
you had both male and female
reproductive parts.

194
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,800
-What?
-That's right. We said your parents..

195
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:41,240
flipped a coin, decided to raise you
as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.

196
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,120
-Oh, my God!
-You started that?

197
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,680
-You heard that?
-Everyone at our school heard it!

198
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,040
Everyone at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?

199
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,120
Oh, no!

200
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,480
It makes sense now. This is why
Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.

201
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,600
Why Billy would just stay
in this region.

202
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,800
Billy's gay now, so that one's
not really our fault.

203
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,400
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I thought it might be true.

204
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,800
I was afraid that you were gonna cry
and then show it to me.

205
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,560
Stop staring! There's nothing there!
It's not true!

206
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

207
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,800
Come on, whip it out.

208
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,920
You are my Everest.

209
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,320
-You don't have to finish.
-I do. Otherwise, what's next?

210
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,560
Today I can't finish a turkey,
but tomorrow I eat half a PowerBar..

211
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,920
wrap it up and put it
in the fridge? No!

212
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I gotta change my pants. What was
I thinking? Jeans have no give.

213
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
Guys, help me with the dishes.
There's a lot of pots and pans.

214
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,760
Honey, I'd love to,
but the second game is about to start.

215
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,440
Oh, yeah, the second game.
More football for the Pheebster.

216
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,760
-Who's playing?
-Los Angeles.

217
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,640
Last time I checked,
Los Angeles didn't have a football team.

218
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,520
Did I say Los Angeles? I meant the team
that used to be in Los Angeles..

219
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,280
and is now in St. Louis.
I actually knew that.

220
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,280
Okay, quick, name three players
on that team.

221
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
Gretzky..

222
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,160
Agassi..

223
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm a pretty little girl.

224
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,560
Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.

225
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,520
"Dear Rach, you're such a great
person." Not girl, "person."

226
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,400
I think you're reading a little
too much into it.

227
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,360
"You're a great person.
Sorry about your teeny weenie."

228
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,360
What do you want me to do..

229
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,600
call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?

230
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,240
-Yes.
-Also, tell them I'm skinny now.

231
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,200
Oh! Me too!

232
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,800
I won't call anybody.
It was a million years ago.

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,240
I don't care. You told people
that I was half and half!

234
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,080
I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.

235
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
That's not totally true.

236
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,040
-What?
-What?

237
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,920
You did start that rumor about Ross..

238
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,720
making out with Mrs. Altmann,
our 50-year-old librarian.

239
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,360
How did you know that?

240
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
-It's true?
-No.

241
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,160
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it
behind the card catalog.

242
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,160
-Hey, what were you doing in the library?
-They had magazines.

243
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out..

244
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,880
with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night
before he went back to Thailand.

245
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,480
In high school you made out
with a 50-year-old woman?

246
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,680
-Hey, she didn't look 50!
-Did she look 16?

247
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,880
There's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.

248
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,080
-Wow.
-She didn't photograph well!

249
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,600
She probably wasn't familiar
with the process..

250
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,720
having spent most of her life sitting
for oil paintings.

251
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,680
How did this happen? Did she lure
you to an early-bird dinner?

252
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,880
I was working late in the library
one afternoon. It was just the two of us.

253
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,880
She needed some help
with her word jumble.

254
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,880
And one thing led to another.

255
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,840
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.

256
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
May she rest in peace.

257
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,680
-Didn't she walk with a cane?
-Only when it was damp!

258
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,920
I can't believe you told people
about this. Everybody knew?

259
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,320
-You know what? I'm back in the club!
-Yeah!

260
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,280
-Shall I call the meeting to order?
-Is everybody present?

261
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,800
With the exception of Ta-Taka.

262
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
-I wanna join!
-Phoebe?

263
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.
I didn't go to high school.

264
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,800
But three of us would meet behind
a dumpster to learn French.

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Fine, you can have
your stupid, little club.

266
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,240
But what you did to me is way worse
than what I did to you.

267
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,760
-You gave me a teeny weenie.
-Yeah!

268
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,640
You're just being silly.
Rachel, even with that rumor..

269
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,920
you were one of the most popular girls.
Everyone wanted to be like you.

270
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,800
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.

271
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,720
Wow.

272
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,040
And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor,
no one would've known who you were.

273
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,040
-She put you on the map.
-As a romancer of the elderly.

274
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,280
Mrs. Altmann, you can tell,
she used to be pretty.

275
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,360
The eyes did still sparkle.

276
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,480
This stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.

277
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,320
You got so much more
important stuff going on in your life.

278
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,920
Can't you just let this go?

279
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,880
-She's right.
-We are having a baby together.

280
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,920
Hold on.

281
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,720
-You got her pregnant?
-Yeah.

282
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,440
-Are you getting married?
-No.

283
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,160
So you knocked her up but you're
not gonna marry her. Dude.

284
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
-Anybody?
-Okay.

285
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,880
It's exactly how I imagined
it would be.

286
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,120
All right, where's that turkey?

287
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,080
-Those are my maternity pants!
-No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

288
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,360
Well, that's it. I'm done.

289
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,680
Here come the meat sweats.

290
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,600
Well, Joey, we're all
very proud of you.

291
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,600
I believe we can expect a call
from the president any moment now.

292
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,800
-Anything we can do?
-No. Just nobody press on my stomach.

293
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,880
You can keep those pants, by the way.

294
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,000
What you got there?
What is that, pie?

295
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,160
-Yeah. You want some?
-Just cut me a little sliver.

296
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,320
Little bigger.

297
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,880
Little bigger.

298
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,080
Are you afraid you're gonna run out?
Cut me a real piece!
