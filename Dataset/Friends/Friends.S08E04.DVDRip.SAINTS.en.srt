1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,560
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,440
I had a great time on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,080
I can't wait
to spend our life together.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,360
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
You're back!

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,320
Come on in!

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,800
How was the honeymoon?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,200
So much fun. The best part is,
we met this great couple.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,760
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,080
They're cool.
It was their honeymoon too.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,240
They live here in the city.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,520
Can we go call them?
Is it too soon to call?

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,680
We're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,040
Oh, were you looking for that?

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
Well, yeah.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,440
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,920
It's different.
Greg and Jenny are married.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,600
Greg and Jenny?
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,800
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,680
-They're great. If you just..
-You know what?

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,160
Give us our souvenirs
and get out of here.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,800
-We didn't get a chance to..
-You're kidding!

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,000
-We didn't get anything for anyone.
-Nice necklace.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,040
That you can have.

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,160
-Welcome home.
-How was the honeymoon?

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,280
Great! How about you?
You're having a baby!

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah, we are. It's so exciting.

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,240
I always knew you two
would have a child out of wedlock.

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,000
-Look, I have a sonogram picture.
-Good.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,520
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,400
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?
When? How many times?

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,320
Monica, that's not right.
Start with where.

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,280
It happened about six weeks ago.

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,560
I got home and Ross was there.
He'd been hanging out with Joey.

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,440
You're welcome, buddy.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Yeah, thanks.

37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,840
I had a lot of work,
and Ross offered to help.

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,600
We had wine, we got to talking.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Next thing you know,
Ross comes on to me.

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,400
That's a little misleading.

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,720
-What is?
-The lie you just told.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,400
-That you came on to me?
-There's the one!

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,240
-But you did. Let's be honest.
-Yes, let's.

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,560
Ross. If it helps, I don't believe you.

45
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
It's not important.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,360
What's important is, we're having
a baby, not who came on to who.

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,600
"Whom."

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
That's right.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
-You kissed me first.
-You were begging for it!

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,400
You were sending me signals!

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,000
I was sending signals? Anyone think
that I'd send Ross begging signals?

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,600
Please, show of hands.

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,840
It doesn't matter what people believe!
It happened.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,200
Maybe I need to be more careful.
Am I sending these signals now?

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,800
-You know what? Just drop it.
-Show me how I begged you.

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,560
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
It's an expression.

58
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Come on, Rachel, open up.
Let me explain.

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,440
-Still won't let you in, huh?
-No.

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm just gonna close this door
so we can talk about you.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,240
I can't believe
he taped them having sex.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,360
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,480
Such a rookie mistake.

64
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,240
-Know who has a great camera?
-Greg and Jenny?

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,360
-I want to call them.
-Let's call.

66
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,720
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,400
Hello. 8th Street Deli?

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,480
Hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

69
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,680
-Sorry, wrong number.
-Here you go, babe.

70
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,000
Hello?
It's the deli again!

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,960
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

72
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,040
I don't think this number's right.

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,440
-What?
-You got fake-numbered.

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
-What? People don't do that.
-Oh, I think we do.

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,640
-Why would they do that?
-I don't know.

76
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,840
You were a delight.
You asked those great questions.

77
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,800
And you were never funnier.
Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,480
You still got me and Phoebe.

79
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,400
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

81
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
I wonder why, pervert.

82
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,080
Okay, I am not a pervert.

83
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,440
That's, like, the pervert motto.

84
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,040
You raise your hand, put your left
hand down your pants and repeat that.

85
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,120
Filming Rachel was not planned.

86
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,440
Here's what happened.
Joey can back me up.

87
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,440
A month and a half ago, remember
I came to you with a problem?

88
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,640
The personal thing?

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,680
-What personal thing?
-About sex?

90
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,440
That I hadn't had sex in months?

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

92
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,400
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,240
Sure.

94
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,960
How about you showering
with your mom?

95
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,240
I actually had a topic in mind.

96
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,680
-For, like, months?
-Five, to be..

98
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,800
lying. Six.

99
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,400
Six months? That's rough.

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,800
It's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the small things, like..

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,400
the sound of a bird
and the color of the sky.

102
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,240
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

103
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,160
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

105
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,000
I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it is putty.

107
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,560
Tell it to me.

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

109
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Remember, it is just the story.

110
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll try to control myself.

111
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,400
Years ago, I was backpacking
across Western Europe..

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,800
-You were backpacking across Europe?
-Have a nice six more months.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and..?

114
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,120
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

115
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,800
-Nice.
-Thanks.

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,000
I was at the end of this path,
and there was a lake.

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,080
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

118
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
It was dead silent.
Gorgeous.

119
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,680
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

120
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,720
But she was crying.

121
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,840
Why?

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,640
This is great wine.

123
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,040
It's from France.

124
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,880
In Europe.

125
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,600
Western Europe.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,160
A few years ago I was backpacking
across Western Europe.

127
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,960
-Really?
-Wait, it gets better.

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.

129
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,360
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,240
-You did?
-Yeah. When were you there?

131
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
-Eighty..
-Nine?

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,080
Three.

133
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,440
I was 13?

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,800
-So anyway, I was hiking..
-I love hiking!

135
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,880
That's great!

136
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,000
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo..

137
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,200
-I think it's "Tibidabo."
-Do you want to tell the story?

138
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,840
How'd your date go?

139
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,880
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

140
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,200
-Your story sucks.
-Then you didn't tell it right.

141
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,640
-Show me how you did it.
-No, I don't want to.

142
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,960
-How long since you seen a girl naked?
-I was backpacking..

143
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,200
-I'm not feeling it.
-I was outside Barcelona, hiking..

144
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,840
-Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
-It's been six months. I'm always hot.

145
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,920
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

146
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,000
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

147
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,520
Do what I do before an audition.

148
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,320
I'm not hungry.

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,000
No.

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,440
Use my camera to record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

151
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
I'll try that.

152
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,400
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.
Just hit record. Good luck.

153
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,760
If you ever have any problem with the
ladies, you know I'll help you out.

154
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,720
That means a lot to me, man.

155
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,800
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

156
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,720
Ross, thank God you're here.
You have to help me.

157
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,600
Were you talking to yourself?

158
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,400
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

159
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,440
When she came in,
I totally forgot about the camera.

160
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,120
It kept rolling
and recorded everything.

161
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,840
Yeah, we're gonna need
to see that tape.

162
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,360
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

163
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,960
Come on, it'll be like watching
the Discovery Channel..

164
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
only we'll know the monkeys.

165
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Look, I'm not gonna let you guys
watch us.

166
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,000
-I haven't even seen it yet.
-I'll trade you two tapes of me having sex.

167
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
Thanks, I'm good.

168
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,040
We don't wanna see the dirty stuff..

169
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,000
-just the stuff leading up to it.
-No. Rachel's gonna kill me as it is.

170
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,040
It's not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

171
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,360
Thank you.

172
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,000
-No.
-You're right.

173
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,280
-Joey, no.
-Loud and clear.

174
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,560
I don't get why
they'd give us a fake number.

175
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,600
If they knew what they were doing,
they didn't give you real names.

176
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,760
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but not fake names.

177
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,760
Hi. Ken Adams.
Nice to meet you.

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,960
Regina Phalange.

179
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,320
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-I know.

180
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

181
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,040
You said they were funny.
Joke, joke, joke!

182
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,800
Joke, joke..

183
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
-It was your questions.
-What about them?

184
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,560
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

185
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,600
-Was that another joke?
-Was that another question?

186
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
Is Ross still here?

187
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,520
Watch out, honey.
Someone else is asking questions now.

188
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,120
No, but he told us what happened.
It was an honest mistake.

189
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,960
How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

190
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,320
Oh, forget it.

191
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,880
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

192
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,040
It was an accident, okay?

193
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,320
I feel bad.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

194
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Anyway, here.

195
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,320
You might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

196
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,520
Thank you.

197
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,480
What?

198
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,320
-You don't want to see this, do you?
-Hell, yeah!

199
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,720
I am not gonna show you this.

200
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,760
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,960
Forget it.

202
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,800
We'll think of another way to put the
"who came on to who" thing to rest.

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,840
Come on now, think!

204
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,640
It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants.

205
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,160
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,040
-I want to see it.
-What?

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,360
You don't want us to see this.

208
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,640
You so badly don't want us to see it
that it makes me want to see it.

209
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,560
Are we watching the tape or not?

210
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,640
-It's for your sake.
-I don't believe you.

211
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,320
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

212
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,320
-Rachel, please?
-Oh, a little preview.

213
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,960
Fine. I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

214
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,440
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying..

215
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,680
Okay, here we go.

216
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,200
I'm so happy.

217
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,280
Thank God you're here. Help me.
Were you talking to yourself?

218
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,320
-There I am.
-You're gonna get pregnant.

219
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,560
I screwed up so bad.

220
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,840
I told Monica that I'd send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

221
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,440
You didn't do it?

222
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,720
I put them in my desk at work,
and forgot about them until today.

223
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,560
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it
to the wedding. I'm fine.

224
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,080
-Kind of hurting my hand though.
-I know.

225
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,480
I can't believe it, especially after
Monica went on and on about it.

226
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,920
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.

227
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,720
Please, drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

228
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,280
Did you do it on our invitations?

229
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,680
Not on the ones we sent out.

230
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,080
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

231
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,480
It seems like yesterday
they just got engaged.

232
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,440
I know.

233
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Remember the night they got engaged?
How you and I almost..

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh, I remember how we almost.

235
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,800
You think we would've
gone through with it?

236
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,680
You think we would have done it?

237
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,760
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you did.

238
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,680
Oh, I wanted to.

239
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,480
So we both wanted to.

240
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,480
Interesting.

241
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,880
Anyway, it probably worked out
for the best.

242
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,160
Yeah, sure.

243
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,800
In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.

244
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,440
In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.

245
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,840
Did I ever tell you about the time
I backpacked through Western Europe?

246
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Get ready to see some begging.

247
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,560
-Oh, you came on to Ross!
-What?

248
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,240
Now I'm so happy.

249
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,400
-What?
-You used the Europe story!

250
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,080
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

251
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,120
-How do you know about that story?
-How do you know about that story?

252
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,560
My friend Irene heard it
from some guy.

253
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,360
Some guy!

254
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,280
No, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

255
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,800
Ken Adams!

256
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,720
So, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

257
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,520
About that, the "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

258
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,600
It would have happened either way.

259
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,680
If you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

260
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,480
-It was an amazing night.
-It was. It was amazing.

261
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
You think it looked amazing?

262
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,480
I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

263
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,320
Yeah, me neither.

264
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,680
Yet.

265
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,560
-That may be weird.
-Yeah, it would be really weird.

266
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,240
-Good luck.
-Good luck to you.

267
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,400
-Mind if I mute?
-Oh, please.

268
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,400
-There go the clothes.
-You are undressing awfully quickly.

269
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,680
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

270
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,760
-We look pretty good.
-I was gonna say.

271
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,880
-Nice tan.
-Thank you.

272
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,280
I'd just gone to
the beach that weekend.

273
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,520
-Have you been working out?
-I have been working out.

274
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,480
This is so much better
than I ever..

275
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh, that's not pretty.

276
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,480
-Make it stop. Make it stop.
-Oh, no!

277
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,520
Greg and Jenny's number
is totally different in here.

278
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,040
-I don't ask too many questions, do I?
-No.

279
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
-Really?
-Absolutely not.

280
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,680
-Really?
-Oh, God.

281
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,040
I bet that phone thing was some sort
of mix-up. I'm gonna call them.

282
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,440
Hello, Greg?
This is Monica from the plane.

283
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,360
Listen, the number that
you gave me, 8-5-3..

284
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
Jenny's been giving out
their old number!

285
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,600
Jenny! That is so Jenny!

286
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,720
How would you like to
get together next Saturday?

287
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,960
Okay, how about Sunday?

288
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,560
Okay, the week after that?

289
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,440
The week after that?

290
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,640
You know what? We are interesting,
funny people with good questions.

291
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,480
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that..

292
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,280
January 15?

293
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,000
We'll see you then!
