1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,664
Okay, pick a card. Any card.

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,305
All right, now memorize it.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,771
Show it to everybody.

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:10,943
Got it?

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,510
All right. Give it back to me.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,784
Five of hearts.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,311
Real magic does exist.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,720
- Joey, how do you do it?
- I can't tell you that.

9
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,432
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,462
That's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,297
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

12
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:43,033
Why don't you go ask him to just,
"Step lightly, please?"

13
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:47,071
I have, like, five times.
But the guy is so charming...

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,716
...I go up there to yell,
then I end up apologizing to him.

15
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,112
That is silly!

16
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,583
I'll go up there.
I'll tell him to keep it down.

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,654
- All right, be my guest.
- Good luck.

18
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:58,983
All right, all right...

19
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,184
...if you wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,488
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

21
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:10,032
...I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

22
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,138
I just did it.

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,833
Just did it again.

24
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,840
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

25
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,780
- I got it now!
- Okay.

26
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,827
Thank you.

27
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:52,876
The One Where Chandler
Can't Remember Which Sister

28
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,649
Hi. Anybody got a length of rope
about six feet long...

29
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,756
...little noose at the end?

30
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,086
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I just saw Janice.

31
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:47,631
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating
with her husband. She looked so happy.

32
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,565
I almost feel bad for whipping
that kid's pretzel at them.

33
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,700
I remember the first time I saw
Katherine after we broke up.

34
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,106
She was with her friend Donna.
Just laughing and talking.

35
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,177
God, it killed me!

36
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:05,511
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

37
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,821
Sorry, I just... Any excuse
to tell that story, you know?

38
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,622
Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

39
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:18,388
I'm gonna be okay. You don't
have to throw a party for me.

40
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,066
It's Joey's birthday.

41
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,893
Then if anybody should have a party,
it should be him.

42
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,073
I cannot believe
she's still up there.

43
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,283
Well, he totally screwed up
the punch line.

44
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,752
You know, it's supposed to be...

45
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,598
- How's that coffee coming, dear?
- Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

46
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,602
I'm not suppose to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.

47
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,997
I know.

48
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,710
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl...

49
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,871
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

50
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,880
You got me.

51
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,519
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

52
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,851
I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

53
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,390
- How does that sound?
- That sounds great!

54
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,960
- Come on over here, sweetheart.
- Thank you so much.

55
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,362
I need these hangers separated
ASAP.

56
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,035
You're welcome.

57
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:41,040
- Oh, God, I hate my job! I hate it.
- I know, honey. I'm sorry.

58
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,683
I wanna quit, but then
I think I should stick it out.

59
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:45,976
Then I think:

60
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,416
"Why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

61
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,616
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?"

62
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,423
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,124
Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

64
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,203
Come on, I'm sorry. I didn't...
I don't mind paying my dues, you know?

65
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,636
But how much will I learn
about fashion...

66
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,778
...by walking Myra, the arthritic
seamstress, to the bathroom?

67
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,217
Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?

68
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,212
I'm sorry, I was just...

69
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,514
It's not funny.
This is actually my job.

70
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,384
No, believe me, I've been there.

71
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,550
I had to sort mannequin heads
at that Mannequins Plus.

72
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:33,289
Well, then. I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

73
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,024
You can go back to enjoying
your little hamburger.

74
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,398
Actually, that's
a Barbra Streisand-wich.

75
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,000
What? I named that one.

76
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,909
- Just one other thing.
- Yes?

77
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,842
I work at Bloomingdale's.

78
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:53,109
I might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

79
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,283
Do you want my pickle?

80
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,861
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Gunther.

81
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,693
You're going on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

82
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,496
- Well, he's very charming.
- I know. He's too charming!

83
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,004
But if you go out,
it'll be harder for me to hate him.

84
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,235
Well, you're just going
to have to try.

85
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,204
Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

86
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,645
I don't know.
Chandler's passing them...

87
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,547
Chandler!

88
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,688
Hello-dee-lo!

89
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,884
Well, somebody's feeling better.

90
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,018
- Stick out your tongue!
- Take off your shirt!

91
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,499
- Oh, my...!
- Oh, my God!

92
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,295
How many did you have?
These are pure vodka.

93
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,371
Yeah, Jell-O.
Just like Mom used to make.

94
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,177
The most unbelievable thing
happened today.

95
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,870
I'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me.

96
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,345
He works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's.

97
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,078
There's an opening there!
So I gave him my phone number.

98
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,551
He's gonna call me this weekend
to get me an interview!

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,419
I know!

100
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,461
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

101
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:18,399
- And he's a total stranger?
- Yeah. His name is Mark something.

102
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,573
Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex!

103
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,970
What?

104
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:29,808
I'm just saying. Why else would he
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

105
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,074
To be nice.

106
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,277
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

107
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,922
- No, only for sex.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,119
So did you tell
Mark Something about me?

109
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:44,963
I didn't have to.

110
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:50,158
I was wearing my "I Heart Ross"
sandwich board and ringing my bell.

111
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,796
Joey!
Happy birthday!

112
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,838
How many of that girl are you seeing?

113
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,314
How hammered are you?
These are Joey's sisters.

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,488
Hi, Joey's sisters!

115
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,249
What are we drinking over here?

116
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,617
Well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

117
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,886
No kidding?

118
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:22,056
That's the same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,638
Okay, I don't know how
to talk to you.

120
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,705
What you doing?

121
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,245
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

122
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,438
No, it's a good thing.

123
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,050
Why must we dial so speedily, anyway?
Why rush through life?

124
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,414
Why can't we savor
the precious moments?

125
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,557
Those are some huge breasts you have!

126
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,889
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:53,225
So I heard about this Mark guy
that Rachel met today.

128
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,026
- Isn't it great?
- Oh, yeah!

129
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,500
So yeah, pretty good...
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

130
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,572
Oh, he is.
And he is so dreamy!

131
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,642
I mean, when he left,
I actually used the phrase:

132
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,745
"Hummina, hummina, hummina."

133
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,750
That's excellent.

134
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,621
So he's "just a nice guy."

135
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,049
Do you really think this Mark
doesn't want anything for helping you?

136
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,355
Well, I assume I'll have
to take showers with him.

137
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,261
But, you know, that's true of any job.

138
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,532
How you feeling?

139
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,335
Well, my apartment isn't
there anymore because I drank it.

140
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,843
Where'd you go? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

141
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,342
I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

142
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,654
No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

143
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,887
Why, what happened?

144
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,799
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

145
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,669
- That's not the worst part.
- What is the worst part?

146
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,896
I can't remember which sister.

147
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,870
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

148
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,670
This is men!

149
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,509
Are you insane?

150
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,480
Joey will kill you.
He'll actually kill you dead.

151
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,518
You don't think I thought of that?

152
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,987
- How can you not know which one?
- That's unbelievable.

153
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,819
- Was it Gina?
- Which one's Gina?

154
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,222
The dark, big hair,
with airplane earrings.

155
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,157
No, that's not Gina. That's Dina.

156
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,664
You see? You can't tell
which is which either!

157
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,371
We didn't fool around
with any of them.

158
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,872
It's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

159
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,139
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat!

160
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,516
That was me.

161
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,350
When I drink, sometimes
I get overly friendly and I'm sorry.

162
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,923
- That's okay.
- That's all right.

163
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,822
That's okay.

164
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,592
Can I talk to you for a second?

165
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,230
Hey, Joey!

166
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,439
Come on.

167
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,042
Why can't we talk in here...

168
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,144
...with witnesses?

169
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,643
I just got off the phone
with my sister.

170
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,406
- Which one?
- Mary Angela.

171
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,084
- Mary Angela.
- Yeah.

172
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,487
Now which one is she again?

173
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,748
Why don't you ask Chandler?
He fooled around with her.

174
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,017
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

175
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:39,926
Is that true, or are you just getting
over Janice by groping my sister?

176
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,396
It's gotta be the first one.

177
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,465
Really?

178
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,799
That's great!

179
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,540
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

180
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,673
Yep, I'm in a tree.

181
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,111
Did he call? Did Mark call?

182
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,048
No, honey, I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

183
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,058
Oh, my God! Is that Phoebe?

184
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,456
Guess they're back from their date.

185
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,564
Music!

186
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,759
Very nice!

187
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,871
Oh, my God!

188
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,215
- So how are you?
- I am good. I finished my book.

189
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,581
- What's it about?
- I don't remember.

190
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,587
- Do you wanna take a walk?
- Yeah, I do.

191
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,055
"Dear Mary Angela:

192
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,855
Hi, how's it going?

193
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,533
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write."

194
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,225
What the hell's the matter with you?

195
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,066
How will Joey react to you
blowing off his sister with a letter?

196
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,607
That's the part where you tell him
that I moved to France...

197
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,469
...when actually I'll be in Cuba.

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,447
Look, you've got to do this yourself.
In person. At least you know her name.

199
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,246
You just go to the house
and ask for Mary Angela.

200
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,548
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

201
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,954
...you take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

202
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:19,188
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and I ask for Mary Angela?

203
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,797
Where in Cuba?

204
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,111
Joey! What are you doing here?

205
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,613
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

206
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,754
- What about you?
- I'm here to see Mary Angela.

207
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,617
You are so the man! Come on.

208
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,859
Now look, listen.
Listen...

209
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,122
Be cool, because Grandma
doesn't know about you two.

210
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,323
And you do not wanna tick her off.

211
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,664
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

212
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,932
- Where are your parents?
- They're in Vermont, buying cigarettes.

213
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,044
Where's Mary Angela?

214
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,646
- She's right in there.
- Okay.

215
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,778
- Hey, Chandler!
- Hey, Chandler!

216
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,618
I can't believe Mark didn't call.

217
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,555
- It's Sunday night and he didn't call.
- Bummer.

218
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,227
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

219
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,163
I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

220
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,430
Look, Rach, I want
only good things for you.

221
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,235
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

222
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,808
Who says you have to sit
and wait for him?

223
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,709
You've got to make stuff happen!

224
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,444
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

225
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,486
It's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

226
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,715
He gave you his home number,
as in, to his home?

227
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,894
And you don't mind if I call,
because you want good things for me.

228
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,193
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

229
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:09,039
Hello. Mark?
Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

230
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,078
Oh, no.
Don't you apologize.

231
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,407
Yeah, I'll hold.

232
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,177
He left my number at work
and was gonna get it...

233
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,946
...but he had to help his niece
with her report on the pioneers.

234
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,680
That is so made up!

235
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,085
Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

236
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,023
That's... No, it's perfect.

237
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,459
Oh, God! Thank you so much!

238
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,098
Great. Bye.

239
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,626
- I got the interview!
- There you go!

240
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,930
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

241
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,164
That is amazing!

242
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,401
Well, if I know Mark,
and I think I do...

243
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,704
...I'd expect nothing less.

244
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,438
I gotta figure out what to wear.

245
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,449
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro!"

246
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,312
Yeah, right.
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

247
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,651
You go get them!

248
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,919
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

249
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,128
- What?
- "Why don't you call him?"

250
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,770
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her...

251
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,964
...as in what you do before
you surgically remove the boyfriend!

252
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,375
Are you crazy?

253
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:22,138
Am I? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

254
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,249
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend
out for a meal!

255
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,247
This isn't even about you!

256
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,082
It's about something wonderful
happening for Rachel.

257
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,321
Even if you're right,
and he wants to sleep with her...

258
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,460
...does that mean he gets to?

259
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,596
- No, but...
- Don't you trust her?

260
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,726
Then get over yourself!
Grow up!

261
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,031
You grow up.

262
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:05,316
This tiramisu is excellent.
Did you make it, Mary Angela?

263
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,889
No, I did.

264
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,787
Well, it's yummy.

265
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,592
So... Mary Angela, do you like it?

266
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,098
Of course. It's her favorite.

267
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:24,133
So... Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

268
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,867
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

269
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,979
Oh, would you just please...

270
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,250
...give me your recipe,
because this is great! It's topnotch!

271
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,613
That dies with me.

272
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,652
So will I.

273
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,589
Excuse yourself
and go to the bathroom.

274
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,194
I was just squinting.
It doesn't mean anything.

275
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,920
Just do it!

276
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,231
Will you excuse me, I have to...

277
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,883
Finally! I thought we'd never be alone.
Can I just tell you something?

278
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,821
I have not stopped thinking
about you since the party.

279
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,727
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.

280
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,564
I just got out of a relationship...

281
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,637
...and I'm not really
in a in a commitment kind of place.

282
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,898
So? Me neither!

283
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,704
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

284
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,846
You're not Mary Angela?

285
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,107
No! I'm Mary Therese!

286
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,584
This is so bad.

287
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,550
If you're not Mary Angela,
then who is?

288
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,518
I am.

289
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,584
Oh, it's so bad.

290
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,624
- Joey!
- No Joey! No Joey! No Joey!

291
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,197
- Joey.
- What's going on?

292
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,093
You're it! Now run and hide!

293
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,831
It's no big deal.
Chandler was just kissing me...

294
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,235
...because he thought
I was Mary Angela.

295
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,378
What? How could you think
she was Mary Angela?

296
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,605
I wasn't sure which one
Mary Angela was.

297
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:16,684
Look, I'm sorry. I was really drunk
and you guys all look really similar.

298
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,653
- I say punch him, Joey!
- Yeah, punch him!

299
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,792
We should all calm down...

300
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,519
...because your brother's
not gonna punch me.

301
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,222
- Are you?
- That is usually what I would do.

302
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,266
But I never thought you'd be
on the receiving end of it.

303
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,767
How could you do this?

304
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,905
Hey, where'd everybody go?

305
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,905
Why don't you go into the den?
I think Cops is on.

306
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,713
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

307
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:50,287
But I want you to know that I'd never
soberly hurt you or your family.

308
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,354
You're my best friend.

309
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,585
And I would never do anything
like this, ever again.

310
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,723
So what? I say punch him!

311
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,365
Yeah, punch him!

312
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,165
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

313
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,662
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't!

314
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:12,009
He knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him. He's sorry.

315
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,580
But you got one more apology to make.
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

316
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:20,047
- Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
- All right.

317
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,296
- Cookie, now you can punch him!
- What?

318
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,739
Hey! What are you doing here?

319
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,033
You know, this building's
on my paper route, so...

320
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,411
How did it go?

321
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,208
The woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough...

322
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,145
...but thank God Mark coached me.

323
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,253
Once I talked about the Fall line,
she got all happy.

324
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,447
- I'm so proud of you.
- Me too!

325
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,354
Listen, I'm...

326
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,964
I'm sorry I've been so crazy
and jealous and...

327
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,429
It's just, I like you a lot, so...

328
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,728
- I know.
- Yeah?

329
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,928
- Rachel. Hi.
- Hi, Mark.

330
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,669
I just talked to Joanna,
and she loves you. You got the job.

331
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,742
- I did?
- Yes!

332
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,038
Oh, my God!

333
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,747
Congratulations...

334
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,082
So, Phoebe, how was your date?

335
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,282
Oh, well, you know...

336
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,961
Yeah, I do know.

337
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,527
You were eavesdropping?

338
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,666
Eavesdropping? Pheebs,
the ceiling tiles were falling down.

339
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,868
Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,868
But I really like this guy...

341
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,338
...and I think he really
happens to likes me.

342
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,842
Maybe he's just...

343
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,144
...jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

344
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,915
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

345
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,627
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe!

346
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,027
This guy's gonna get
the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

347
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,428
But is he a big guy?

348
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,898
We'll all go. Come on.

349
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,335
Well, let's see,
I just got beat up by a girl...

350
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,202
They need me.

351
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,740
- Thanks, you guys. Thank you!
- Don't worry!

352
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,404
God!
I hope they kick his ass!

353
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,015
Honey, I'm sorry.

354
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,708
If it's any consolation...

355
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,651
...he really did sound like
he was having more fun with you.
