1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,880
Is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary?

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
-Sure.
-Yeah.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
-Who's the guy?
-Parker, we met at the cleaners.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,120
Who said that?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,160
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,920
He treats me like a queen. Except
when he treats me like a naughty girl.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,880
Would it be okay if I give the toast?

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Even after what happened
at their 20th?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,400
-I'd really like to.
-Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,800
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,440
-This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
-You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,560
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone
cries and pats him on the back.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,280
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,680
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, at least one
person will be crying.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,320
-Really? You can do that?
-Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,120
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me!

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,280
Hey.

21
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,880
Oh, my God.
You look so fantastic.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,120
On my way over,
I pictured you in my mind's eye.

23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,840
Now I'm like,
"Mind's eye, you had no idea!"

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,040
-Let's do that again!
-Okay.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,760
-What are you doing?
-I'm working on my toast.

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,320
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,720
I cannot wait to see them cry.

28
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,000
It's not gonna be like regular crying. It's
gonna be like Terms of Endearment crying.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,320
I'm gonna reduce my parents
to sniffling, quaking masses of..

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,720
I may have some unresolved anger
from my childhood.

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,960
-Hey, check this out.
-It's a dog.

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,600
It's a dead dog.

33
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Chi-Chi. She died
when I was in high school.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,600
-You're talking about a dead pet?
-It's good stuff, huh?

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,360
Joey? You got a present
for my parents?

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,160
In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,320
-That is so cool.
-And I got Kama Sutra for the Elderly.

38
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,760
You know, I think maybe
the one present is enough.

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,960
-Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
-Sure.

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,440
What do you need? We got lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt..

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,960
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,880
Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,480
Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,480
-What?
-You're the 200-pounder who rode her!

45
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is..

46
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,360
No, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel..

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,160
and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,040
Chandler, I'm kidding!
Already you're my favorite.

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,960
-Tell me a little about yourselves.
-Actually, we should get going.

50
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
Classic Ross!

51
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,080
Rachel, look how you glow! May I?

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,560
I think you already are.

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,040
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,680
Is there anything more miraculous..
A picture of a dog! Whose is this?

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,240
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

56
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,280
Well, at least you were lucky to have
him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

57
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
You guys, we really should get going.

58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,440
There I go again, my catch phrase.

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,840
-So where's the party?
-It's in Massapequa.

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,520
Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it
steeped in Native American history?

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

62
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,920
I've got my notes.
You got the presents?

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,960
-I've got the car keys.
-We're driving? Aces.

64
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,640
-So he seems like a nice guy.
-Yeah, I like him a lot.

65
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,600
-You want to hang back and take a cab?
-Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

66
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,000
-Hey, Mom.
-This is such a great party!

67
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,120
Thirty-five years. Impressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?

68
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,200
-Jack?
-Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,760
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

70
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,640
-Congratulations, you two.
-Thank you, we're so excited.

71
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,360
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

72
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,000
-Can we talk to you for just a moment?
-Yeah.

73
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
It's just a little thing.

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,000
While we think it's marvelous you're
having this baby out of wedlock..

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,320
our friends are less open-minded.

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
-We told them you're married.
-What?

77
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,560
Thanks for going along with this.

78
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,880
-We have to pretend that we're married?
-I had to shave my ears.

79
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,320
You can do this.

80
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
-Can you believe that?
-I know.

81
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,440
If you do the ears, you may as well
take a pass at the nose.

82
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,800
I don't want to have to lie
about being married.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,760
I don't either. But it's their party,
and it's one night.

84
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,400
We don't have to lie.
We won't talk.

85
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,800
If it comes up,
we'll smile, we'll nod along..

86
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
-Ross?
-Rachel?

87
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,400
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

89
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,960
-Here's something to start you out.
-How's marriage treating you?

90
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,600
-Unbelievable. It's great!
-We love marriage.

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,160
We'll see you later.

92
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,480
-Hey!
-Hi!

93
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,280
Can I just say, Monica,
that your driving is exquisite.

94
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,760
Thanks. Like I said before,
I pretty much just stayed in the lines..

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,400
and tried not to hit anybody.

96
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,880
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

97
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,280
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C..

98
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,320
I feel so lucky. Think of the good
times that happened here.

99
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,400
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,320
None will compare with tonight.
I don't want to forget it.

101
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,560
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,280
I don't think the flash went off.

103
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,000
-I'm gonna find the men's room.
-I'll go with you.

104
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
Somewhere there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun..

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,320
and a huge butterfly net looking
for that man.

106
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,440
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

107
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,360
Glad we weren't in the car.
Did he let up?

108
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,680
He called the Long Island
Expressway a "concrete miracle."

109
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
This room. This night.

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,920
That waiter! His shoes!
I must take a mental picture!

111
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
Sorry.

112
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,480
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
That depends, how much did you hear?

114
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,680
He's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

115
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,720
-It's so much.
-Well, so what? I like him.

116
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Do I make fun of the people you date?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

117
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,320
No, because friends don't do that.
Do you want my opinion?

118
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,720
Your collective dating record reads
like a who's who of human crap!

119
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,320
-I feel terrible.
-I know.

120
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
What was wrong with Mona?

121
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,760
-Open it, open it, open it.
-Yeah, baby!

122
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,680
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

123
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,720
-We were surprised we weren't invited.
-No, it was a small wedding.

124
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,440
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

125
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,240
-Where did you have it?
-On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

126
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,480
And Stevie Wonder sang " Isn't She
Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.

127
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,520
-Stevie's a family friend.
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.

128
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,400
-I'd love to see pictures.
-Yeah, so would I.

129
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,920
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
Would you excuse us for a second?

131
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,320
-What are you doing?
-What? This may be my only wedding.

132
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,760
-And I want it to be amazing.
-Okay.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,160
-Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
-Ross, it has to be realistic.

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,960
Say, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

135
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,640
-No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
-And I'm with you. What a great time!

136
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

137
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,160
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

138
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,840
Oysters! Let me feed you.
That's not necessary.

139
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,480
-Please?
-I don't eat..

140
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,920
-I won't quit until you try one.
-Okay, fine.

141
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
-Good.
-What're they like? I've never had one.

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
-Try one.
-They look too weird.

143
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,320
I know, I know.

144
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,480
Listen, your family is really
starting to warm up to me.

145
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,760
You just kissed the caterer.

146
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,040
-What are you doing?
-Going over my toast.

147
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,200
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

148
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,840
If you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just..

149
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,760
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

150
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,280
-Blind?
-Not at first, but it's intricate work.

151
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,600
They said even though they lost
their sight, it was worth it.

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,240
-I bet you looked beautiful.
-Well, I don't know.

153
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,240
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

154
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,080
-How did you propose?
-Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

155
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,160
Well, actually, I took her
to the planetarium.

156
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,040
That's where we had our first date.

157
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,800
I had the room filled with lilies,
her favorite flower.

158
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,040
-That is so sweet!
-I want to hear the rest!

159
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,240
Then Fred Astaire singing,
"The Way You Look Tonight" came on..

160
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,280
the lights came down,
I got on one knee..

161
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,680
and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

162
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,440
"Will you marry me?"

163
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,200
And the ring was the size of my fist.

164
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,640
Hey, Phoebe? Look..

165
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,640
I want to apologize. Okay?
We were being jerks.

166
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,760
-Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.
-You better do it now.

167
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,320
-Why?
-Because I'm gonna kill him.

168
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,040
-What?
-He's too excited about everything.

169
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm all for living, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

170
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,560
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

171
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm having the worst time.

172
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
There was a line for the buffet,
and when I got to the plates..

173
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,040
I slipped on a giant booger.

174
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

175
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,680
It could've been.
I didn't look at it.

176
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,680
I wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out.

177
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,680
I thought he was a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

178
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,200
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

179
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,640
There's nothing wrong with him.

180
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,760
-You think?
-Yeah, know what?

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,560
-We were all just being too negative.
-You're right.

182
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,640
He's just embracing life. We could
all stand to be more like Parker.

183
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,280
You know what? I'm like him!
I'm a positive person!

184
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,600
-Actually, you have an edge.
-What's that?

185
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,280
-Oh, it's Parker!
-Look, the Bunny Hop!

186
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
-Oh, I love it!
-You do?

187
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,800
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on!

188
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,240
Okay, it's time for the toast.

189
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,000
I know normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'll do it.

190
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,720
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

191
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
Okay.

192
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,280
Mom, Dad, when I got married..

193
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,320
the thing that made me sure I could
do it was the example you two set.

194
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,440
For that, and other things,
I want to thank you.

195
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,440
I know I probably don't
say it enough..

196
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,840
but I love you.

197
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,600
When I look around, I'm saddened by the
thought of those who could not be here.

198
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,040
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

199
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,080
But she can't..

200
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,880
because she's dead.

201
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,320
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

202
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,160
I mean, look how cute she is.. was.

203
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,120
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

204
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,200
Remember she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

205
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,640
Wow!

206
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,160
Does anybody remember when..

207
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,720
Debra Winger had to say goodbye to
her children in Terms of Endearment?

208
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,560
Didn't see that?

209
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,880
No movie fans?!

210
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,640
You want to hear something sad?

211
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,960
I was watching a 60 Minutes
piece on orphans in Romania..

212
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,040
who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

213
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,440
You people are made of stone!

214
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,840
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

215
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,280
Thank you, Monica.
That was interesting.

216
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,040
-Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
-Why don't I remember this dog?

217
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,360
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

218
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,280
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

219
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,720
You're not saying anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

220
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,840
No, of course.

221
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,840
Everybody? I just wanted to say..

222
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,120
on behalf of my new bride, Rachel..

223
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,040
and myself, that if..

224
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,960
if in 35 years, we're half
as happy as you guys are..

225
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,240
we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

226
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,600
Oh, Ross.

227
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,960
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

228
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,040
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

229
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,840
Can I get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

230
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,160
I must say, this apartment,
it's.. there are no words.

231
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,880
-Thank God.
-It's a haven.

232
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,200
-A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.
-Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.

233
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,560
Listen, why don't we just sit and
relax, just be with each other quietly.

234
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,040
That sounds great.

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,560
This is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on.

236
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,600
Let's try something.
Let's play a game.

237
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,440
-I love games.
-Shocking.

238
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Let's play the game of..

239
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,240
who can stay quiet the longest.

240
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,320
Or Jenga.

241
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Let's play this one first, and
remember, whoever talks first loses.

242
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,240
-I lose, now Jenga.
-Oh, my God.

243
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,280
-Is something wrong?
-You know the word "wrong"?

244
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,960
Everything isn't perfect or magical?

245
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,760
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of fairies?

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,200
They were just brake lights, Parker!

247
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,240
Excuse me for putting a good spin
on a traffic jam.

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,080
You don't have to put
a good spin on everything!

249
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,840
-I'm sorry. I'm a positive person.
-No, I'm a positive person.

250
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,040
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

251
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,760
At Disneyland, getting laid!

252
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,600
You want me to be negative?
You want me to be less happy?

253
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
Much less happy.

254
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,920
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

255
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,680
So long!

256
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't let the "best door in the world"
hit you in the ass on your way out.

257
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,240
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've had in your life?

258
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,720
We could've gone from the ceremony to
the reception with you in the sidecar.

259
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,720
It just isn't feasible.

260
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,280
But a dove placing the ring on your
finger would've been no problem.

261
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,680
-It was fun being married to you.
-Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.

262
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,560
-Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

263
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,240
-That proposal at the planetarium?
-I know, I know. It was stupid.

264
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,120
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

265
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,160
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

266
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,480
I thought of it
when we were going out.

267
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,240
That's how I imagined
I would ask you to marry me.

268
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,640
Wow.

269
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,840
Well, that would've been
very hard to say no to.

270
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,920
It's a good thing I didn't do it, it
sounds like a very expensive wedding.

271
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,440
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

272
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,400
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
to protect your hair?

273
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,800
-I will think about it.
-That's all I'm asking.

274
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,160
Okay, that's it. I give up.

275
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,840
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you give the speech.

276
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,640
You know, I don't understand
why they didn't cry.

277
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,800
-Come on.
-That stuff you said about true love?

278
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,360
You were right. We did learn
a lot from Mom and Dad.

279
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,160
That picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

280
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,560
And what you said about Nana? Yeah,
she really would've wanted to be there.

281
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,360
And you know what?

282
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,440
I think she was.

283
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,360
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it?
