1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,963
Check it out, this is unbelievable!

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,334
Joey's been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,510
You trying to kill me?

4
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,550
-I want to ask you something.
-What?

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,179
Since I'm moving out,
and you're so beautiful...

6
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,657
how about I move in with you?

7
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,090
That would be great,
but what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,262
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,423
Your roommate?

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,660
Yes, Denise. Denise!

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,805
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?

12
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,066
What about Denise? She cute?

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,003
How can you have a roommate
that we don't know about?

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,513
Because you never listen
to what I say.

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,844
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!

16
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,351
I'm gonna have an extra room
over at my place.

17
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,720
-That's true.
-Move in with me.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,057
We can stay up late talking,
and watch movies.

19
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,459
You know about
naked Thursdays, right?

20
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,436
Yeah, yeah. I think
I'll find my own place.

21
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,638
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

22
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,343
The One With Ross' Denial

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,514
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,878
Oh, that.

25
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,249
She took it really well.

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,222
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,694
Because you're in love with her.

28
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:14,128
I am not in love with her. She was
upset about having to move out.

29
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,234
If she knew we were still married,
she'd have been more upset.

30
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,767
So I comforted her.
As a friend.

31
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,472
You "comforted her"?

32
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,402
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.

33
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,375
A classic sign of love,
the hug.

34
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,047
It's also a sign of friendship.

35
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,183
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson."

36
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,749
It was a hug. Okay?

37
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,411
A simple hug.

38
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,525
I was a friend being a friend
to a friend.

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,820
Use the word "friend" more.

40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,893
Did you, or did you not,
smell her hair?

41
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,327
Smell her hair?

42
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,299
What if I did?

43
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,462
Ninety percent of a woman's
pheromones come out of her head.

44
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,437
That's why women are shorter.

45
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,302
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

46
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,448
Come on, Ross,
you're a scientist.

47
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,043
I was hugging her as a friend.

48
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,617
It's not my fault
her hair got in my face.

49
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,723
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all... all...

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,384
coconutty.

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,561
What? It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

52
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,395
Maybe it means
I have feelings for coconuts.

53
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,735
Okay, but be careful. Rachel's not
in the same place you are.

54
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,838
If the place you're
referring to is being in love...

55
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:36,741
she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

56
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,642
I didn't understand that.

57
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,748
Maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

58
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,829
-A guy just called for you.
-Who was it?

59
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,227
I don't know. How about
"Thanks for taking the message"?

60
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,895
When you move in...

61
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,632
Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,774
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

63
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,246
with a mahogany sleigh bed and
bedside tables with fresh flowers.

64
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,817
And comment cards so people could
tell us how great their stay was.

65
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,252
I really haven't
thought about it that much.

66
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,891
Well, I like that idea... obviously.

67
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,859
I was thinking maybe...
maybe it could be a game room.

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,535
You can buy old arcade games, like
Space Invaders and Asteroids...

69
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,765
for $200. The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!

70
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,802
No.

71
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,039
You mean "No" as in:

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,352
"What an interesting idea. Let's
discuss it before we reject it."

73
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,712
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,325
Interesting idea. But no.

75
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,119
So that's it?

76
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:02,061
I just don't think arcade games
go in a beautiful guest room...

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,462
filled with antiques.

78
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,195
Which is why Asteroids is
perfect. It's the oldest game.

79
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,035
What's wrong with
a beautiful guest room?

80
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,236
I'm not against it.

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,246
Especially since everybody we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

82
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,747
Are you mocking me?

83
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,478
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,889
Monica and I
had a stupid fight.

85
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,533
You're still moving in together,
right? My ad came out today.

86
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,062
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

87
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,374
Nice.

88
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,175
I figured it'd be more interesting
to have a female roommate.

89
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,045
Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

90
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,882
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

91
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,559
than a girl who is 19?

92
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,590
Not just a hatrack, my friend.

93
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,597
Phoebe, I have to ask you..

94
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,359
I'm swamped right now.

95
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,934
You're just staring into space.

96
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,937
I'm trying to move that pencil.

97
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,976
-This one?
-It worked!

98
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,448
Phoebe, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

99
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,451
Anything I can afford comes with
a roommate who is a freak. Look.

100
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,120
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

101
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,867
That's probably some 12-year-old kid
trying to get girls to call.

102
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,137
There's nothing. This city is full.

103
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,397
Wait! Look at this!

104
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,804
"Two bedroom, two bath. Must be
nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay."

105
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,143
Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.

106
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,944
-Rach, you still looking for a place?
-Yeah, why?

107
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,619
This guy, Warren, from the museum
is going on a dig for two years.

108
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,263
He's got this great place he needs
to sublet. You interested?

109
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,923
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!

110
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,503
Oh, wait. Is he the guy that asked you
for naked pictures of me?

111
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,874
That doesn't matter,
he won't be there!

112
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,306
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.

113
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,141
Thank the volcano that erupted
thousands of years ago...

114
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,308
killing, but perfectly preserving,
an entire civilization.

115
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,486
Here's Warren's number.

116
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,993
This is great. I'm gonna
call him right now! Thank you!

117
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,226
Okay, you go call him.

118
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,693
I saw it.

119
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,501
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,698
I'm talking about what you already
know but won't admit.

121
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,343
You love her again. You re-love her.

122
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,276
I do not re-love her.

123
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,144
I can't believe
you won't just admit it.

124
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,916
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

125
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,057
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?

126
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,324
The apartment
is already subletted.

127
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,488
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.

128
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,322
Live with me.

129
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,656
-What?
-What?!

130
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,836
What?

131
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,037
Are you serious?

132
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,937
I would love to live with you.
That's great. Thank you.

133
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,545
I'm just glad I could help you out.

134
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,947
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.

135
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,216
Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

136
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:52,523
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me. You're my hero.

137
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,592
Hero? I don't know.
Well, all right.

138
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,934
I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

139
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,208
Oh, please.

140
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,946
You're gonna say things now,
aren't you?

141
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,385
No. No, I won't.

142
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,891
But I should tell you this.

143
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,056
The same thing happened to my
roommate, Denise.

144
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,492
She moved in with a guy
who was secretly married to her.

145
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,495
He said he didn't love her, but he
really did. And it just blew up.

146
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,430
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

147
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,098
Okay, that's a lie.

148
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,611
-You don't have a roommate.
-Denise!

149
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,173
No one ever listens to me!

150
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,620
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.

151
00:09:55,795 --> 00:10:00,164
I only played those games because I
couldn't get girls. Now I can get..

152
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,194
Now I have you.

153
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,998
No, not that I think I have you...

154
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,572
or think of you as property
in any sort of way. I see women...

155
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,335
Stop it, Chandler.

156
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,940
I'm sorry too.

157
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,279
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh, yes.

158
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,520
We can think of something
to do with the room together.

159
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,556
Great idea. We can easily think of
a way for us both to enjoy the room.

160
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,225
Totally.

161
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,968
-We don't have to decide now.
-Good.

162
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,639
Let's think about changes
we can make in the living room.

163
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,163
Changes?

164
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,904
We'll have to move some
furniture to make room for my chair.

165
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,613
You're bringing the Barcalounger
over here?

166
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,310
Is that a problem?

167
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,383
It's just that they're a set
and should stay together.

168
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,753
That's cool.
I'll bring them both over.

169
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,420
You're taking them away
from their home.

170
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,228
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
here is mine. Everything is yours.

171
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,939
I'll get up in the morning, put on
your clothes and go off to work!

172
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:18,833
Yeah, that's it. Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.

173
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,175
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

174
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,608
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?

175
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,510
In the game room!

176
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,017
It is not my fault your
chairs are incredibly ugly.

177
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,688
That's fine.

178
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,188
I won't bring the chairs.
I won't bring anything!

179
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,850
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance
over here at grandma's place!

180
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,362
Everything on your application
looks really good.

181
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,330
Just one last question.

182
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,767
Will your friends be over here,
partying and hanging out?

183
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,939
Don't worry.
I'm not a party girl.

184
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,410
Don't just be blurting stuff out.

185
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,548
I want you to really think
about your answers.

186
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,782
Call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

187
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,448
Ignore him. He's just some
guy who wants the apartment.

188
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,820
But he's not going to get it.

189
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,793
You took down the shower curtain?

190
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,760
That thing was a hazard!

191
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,568
I'm very safety conscious.

192
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,506
I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

193
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,771
Thanks.

194
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:35,852
But listen, Monica and Chandler had a
big fight and they're not moving in.

195
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,081
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

196
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,822
No, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

197
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,498
Over a stupid room?

198
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:52,304
I feel kind of bad for them, but now
I don't have to move in here!

199
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,198
Oh, no. Yeah, that part's great.

200
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,035
What's all this
about you guys fighting?

201
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,674
Is this really over a room?

202
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,281
That is so silly.

203
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,780
-We can handle this.
-Apparently not.

204
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,121
And I can't stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...

205
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,525
be hurt by something
that is so silly.

206
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,802
Enough of the silliness.

207
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,562
Tell her to stop being silly.

208
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,706
Two very good points.

209
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,408
I've known you both a long time.

210
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,245
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy...

211
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,751
as you've been
since you got together.

212
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,489
Do you really want
to throw that all away over a room?

213
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,856
That is so silly.

214
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,329
What's more important, love...

215
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,663
or silliness?

216
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,539
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

217
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,676
But we also have a soft spot
for the love.

218
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,072
-Love is the best medicine.
-That's "laughter."

219
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,578
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know.

220
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:20,225
Now, Chandler, you want
to live with Monica, right?

221
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,689
Yeah, I do.

222
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,294
And, Mon, you want
to live with Chandler?

223
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,587
Yes.

224
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,960
A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York!

225
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,877
So I understand you're
looking for a place?

226
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,542
No, I'm staying put.

227
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,720
I was going to offer you
my apartment.

228
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,386
Why? Where you going?

229
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,060
I don't know.

230
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,631
You won't believe it.

231
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,828
Monica and Chandler
are moving in again.

232
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,973
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

233
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,678
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

234
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,117
Yeah. You know, about that...

235
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,852
I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...

236
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,752
but don't you think
it'll be weird?

237
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,158
Why? Why would it...
Why would it be weird?

238
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,628
Well, you know,
because of us.

239
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,770
Because of our history.

240
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,830
No!

241
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,104
No, no!

242
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,767
It would only be weird
if we were still in "that place."

243
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,209
Are you still in that place?

244
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,013
-No, not at all.
-Good. Me neither.

245
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,954
So it's not a problem.

246
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,283
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

247
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,950
Okay, but eventually
you and I will be dating.

248
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,855
Really? We are?

249
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,534
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
and you'll have a girlfriend.

250
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,203
That'd be great.

251
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,500
But if you think it'll be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

252
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,308
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door:

253
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,246
"Come back later.
I'm getting lucky."

254
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,092
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

255
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,090
So are you sure about
this whole moving-in thing?

256
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,997
It's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

257
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,607
That's very funny.

258
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,607
He's being silly because
he knows we enjoy the silliness.

259
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,183
No, I'm serious.
Think about it. You move in.

260
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:06,256
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.

261
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,527
It was just a stupid fight
about a room.

262
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,524
There are no stupid fights!

263
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,058
This isn't about the room.

264
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,634
This is about
what the room represents.

265
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,970
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you!

266
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,935
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.

267
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,975
Fine. It's your life!

268
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,407
I just don't want
to see you break up.

269
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,281
Which you will do
if you move in together.

270
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,760
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

271
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,427
Don't do it!

272
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,269
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.

273
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,797
Ross didn't scare you?

274
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,235
Scared me out of wanting
to live with him.

275
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,239
-I gotta show you something.
-Okay.

276
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,276
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!

277
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,183
The Barcalounger can go here.

278
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,152
You can see the TV, and it's still
walking distance to the kitchen.

279
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,155
Oh, that's so sweet.

280
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,457
I want to show you
something too.

281
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,154
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

282
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,431
I thought we could get one of those
signs and hang it over our bed.

283
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,938
Because that's you and I together.

284
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,703
"Merge!"

285
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,477
-I love that!
-Really?

286
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,637
"No!"

287
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,955
I found you in my bed

288
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,485
How'd you wind up there?

289
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,521
You are a mystery

290
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,220
Little black curly hair

291
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,363
Little black, little black,
little black

292
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,472
Little black curly hair

293
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,984
If you want to receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows...

294
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,187
please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

295
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,584
Where are the other guys?

296
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,329
Well, Monica and Chandler
are occupied.

297
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,196
-Fighting?
-The other thing.

298
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,002
It's great they worked things out.

299
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,002
There's no breaking them up,
is there?

300
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,406
Can I borrow the key to your house
so I can go make a copy?

301
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,235
-Here.
-Thank you.

302
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,641
Are you sure? Once I make
a copy, there's no turning back.

303
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,813
Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out
of here before I change my mind.

304
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,426
You think moving in
with Rachel is a good idea?

305
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,066
I've been back and forth.

306
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,036
Well, maybe you should go back.

307
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,739
She moves in,
and before you know it...

308
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,169
you're right where you don't
want to be, back together.

309
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,507
I don't think so. She's already
talking about dating other guys.

310
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,775
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy...

311
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,420
and you'll be telling her, "Oh,
that's okay. You'll find someone."

312
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,022
And then, bam! She finds you!

313
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,756
Maybe you're right.

314
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,522
Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

315
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,893
Is that what you want?

316
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,036
Is that what I want?

317
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,431
Yes.

318
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,100
Here she comes. I'm gonna
make your life much easier.

319
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,338
The place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

320
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,708
Or not.

321
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,177
Why don't you move in with me?

322
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,318
Whoa, Joey!

323
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,584
Look, I know I scared you with
that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

324
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,697
but we don't have to do that.

325
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,392
It would be easier
to move across the hall.

326
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,829
Unless you're thinking about
naked Wednesdays.

327
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,773
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!

328
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,976
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.

329
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,850
There's a lot of people
interested in the room.

330
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,822
But I've narrowed it down,
and you're one of the finalists.

331
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,553
-Great!
-Before I decide...

332
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,755
I want to be sure
our personalities match.

333
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,127
So I made up a little test.

334
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,635
I'll say a word, and you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

335
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,467
-I can do that.
-Okay, here we go.

336
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,108
-Pillow.
-Fight.

337
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,176
Very good.

338
