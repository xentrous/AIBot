1
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,941
I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.

2
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,336
-When's it due?
-On the first.

3
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,012
And that's every month?

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,978
No, just the months
you want to live here.

5
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,521
Okay, here's the phone bill.

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,281
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,357
That's our phone number.

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,026
I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,825
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,233
Joey Tribbiani does not
take charity...

11
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,168
anymore.

12
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,973
-It's not charity, Joe.
-Forget it.

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,409
Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,708
I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,417
Here's the electric bill.

16
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,247
-This is how much we pay for electric?
-Well, yeah.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,894
So we'll do
the rest of the bills later, then?

18
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,829
The One On The Last Night

19
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,667
Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?

20
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,168
I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,839
How much does he need?

22
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,566
$1500 would cover him
for a few months...

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,578
but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

24
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,807
Why don't you hire him as an actor?

25
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:03,114
You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.

26
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,618
Well, that would help the pride thing.

27
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,098
Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?

28
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,927
Any plans for tonight?

29
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,663
Instead of being sad on my
last night with Rachel...

30
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,834
we're going out to celebrate
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

31
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,275
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.

32
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:34,786
What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.

33
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,625
You guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

34
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,625
Instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

35
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,836
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.

36
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,368
I don't know, Ross.

37
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,507
Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.

38
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:01,305
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist!

39
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,309
-Phoebe..
-You're not dressed yet?

40
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,247
We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

41
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,246
And clearly, not a minute sooner.

42
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,654
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?

43
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,092
Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.

44
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,698
I wanted to ask Phoebe
what I should wear.

45
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,495
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.

46
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,105
Oh, my God!

47
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,409
Monica's just gonna kill you.

48
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,841
I know.

49
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,108
What you're wearing is fine
for that.

50
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,113
You're not packed!

51
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,092
You're not packed even a little bit!

52
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,523
Surprise!

53
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,793
Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,536
I started packing,
then I realized, "What am I doing?"

55
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,467
I am lousy at packing, right?

56
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,441
But you love packing!

57
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,611
So as a gift to you
on our last night...

58
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,213
I'll be coordinator!

59
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,820
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

60
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,815
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?

61
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,390
I have plans.

62
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,294
-You have plans with us.
-That's right.

63
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,730
Chandler can make boxes, Ross can
wrap and Joey can lift.

64
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,095
Tell the guys
they have to help out.

65
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,134
My God, thank you!

66
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,965
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!

67
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,576
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves!

68
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,112
The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.

69
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,320
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler..

70
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,453
I have plans with Joey.

71
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,318
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.

72
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,461
Fine. Now, Ross..

73
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,098
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

74
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,792
-Don't you have Ben?
-Because I have Ben!

75
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,432
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?

76
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,040
He's at a dinner party.

77
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,174
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.

78
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,643
Of course he is. What?

79
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,444
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,019
What kind of father do you think I am?

81
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,782
All right. Sorry.

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,983
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

83
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,621
Here it is.

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,358
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

85
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,003
I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.

86
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,899
Well, that's okay.

87
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,506
In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

88
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,702
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

89
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,141
you, the food of yours!

90
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,549
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.

91
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,692
What do you say we play a little
foosball for money?

92
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,920
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

93
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,895
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.

94
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,993
What do you say to $50?

95
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:17,406
I say to it:
"50 dollars, you are more than I have."

96
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,739
If you know that you'll win,
what difference does it make?

97
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,006
-You're on.
-Okay, let's play.

98
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,116
The big game. Italy versus...

99
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,909
China, apparently.

100
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,187
Look, it's the Rollerblades.

101
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,893
Oh, God!

102
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,261
You remember when we got these?

103
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,925
I guess you weren't there.

104
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,537
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

105
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,571
Come on. Hey, remember the time...

106
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,372
You don't remember?

107
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,818
Sorry, Phoebe. I'm just really sad
that I'm leaving.

108
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,919
I'm gonna miss you so much.

109
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,422
This doesn't have to be so sad,
though, you know?

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,754
Instead of thinking about
how you'll miss each other...

111
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,729
you should think of the things
you're not gonna miss.

112
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,431
I don't think there's anything.

113
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,901
Come on, there's gotta be something.

114
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,071
She's perfect.

115
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,506
I have one.

116
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,107
Okay, you can go first.

117
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,648
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...

118
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,947
that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen.

119
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,119
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

120
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,627
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

121
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,425
Sometimes.

122
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,035
Always, actually.

123
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,271
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

124
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,811
Not just the phone pen.

125
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,108
I never get my messages.

126
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,874
You get your messages.

127
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,278
It doesn't count if you have to
read them off your hand...

128
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,388
after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

129
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,184
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

130
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,859
Or your mom?

131
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,027
Or Chandler?

132
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,391
Or your mom?

133
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,232
It worked! No one's sad!

134
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,397
I win again!

135
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,577
That's, like, 500 bucks
you owe me!

136
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,178
Man! Five hundred dollars.

137
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,645
That is a lot of electricity, huh?

138
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,382
I gotta buy some food.

139
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,089
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death...

140
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,054
one goal, $1000.

141
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,152
-You serious?
-Yes!

142
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,695
Get ready to owe me.

143
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,231
Here we go. Ready?

144
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,051
No...

145
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,458
one can beat me!

146
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,903
That's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

147
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,979
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!

148
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,911
Oh, your brother. Score!

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,751
What's up?

150
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,216
I'm here with Ben.

151
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,047
Thought we'd say hi.

152
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,818
-Put him on.
-Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

153
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,325
I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

154
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,058
He's smiling, though.

155
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,161
Okay, talk to you later.

156
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,039
You know, Daddy was gonna be
a basketball player.

157
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,648
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

158
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,360
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?

159
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,666
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.

160
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,301
I wash the toilets 17 times a day,
even if people are on it!"

161
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,234
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight?

162
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,908
I'd better wash it and shrink it!"

163
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,338
"I'm Monica. I never get messages
from interesting people."

164
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,345
I call her.

165
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:57,382
"Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate
Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross!"

166
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,487
"My God!
I can't find a boyfriend.

167
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,890
I'll stumble across the hall and sleep
with the first guy I find there!"

168
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,499
You guys, come on,
this is the last night!

169
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,435
Yeah, you're right, and so for the last time
I would like to ask you:

170
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,006
Boo-hoo. Get out of my room!

171
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:25,811
We should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

172
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,384
Still broken?

173
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,653
It sucks, man.

174
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,694
Your last night, and I lose the two
most important things:

175
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,061
The foosball table...

176
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,098
and $500.

177
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,069
There are other ways to win back
your money. How about blackjack?

178
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,604
Not my game.

179
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,402
You know what?
We can play a new game.

180
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,944
-It's fun!
-What's it called?

181
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,850
Cups.

182
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,845
-I don't know how.
-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.

183
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,922
-All right.
-Here you go.

184
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,395
I have two queens.
What do you have?

185
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,126
-A 2 and a 5.
-You win! Fifty dollars!

186
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,865
-Really?
-Let's play again.

187
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,938
-What have you got?
-4 and a 9.

188
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,067
You're kidding, right?

189
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,713
-No. Why?
-That's a full cup!

190
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,878
Damn, I am good at Cups!

191
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,778
I'm not talking to her.

192
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,615
You have to take the first step...

193
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,294
because she's the one who's
leaving. It's harder for her.

194
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,824
Maybe you're right.

195
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,499
But she made fun of my phone pen!

196
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,463
I know. I took it hard too.

197
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,165
She's in there right now, crying.
I can hear her.

198
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,038
She's not crying.

199
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,014
She's holding it in.
She's so brave. Go.

200
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,120
I feel bad about what happened..

201
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,848
-What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.

202
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,888
I'm not moving.
Is that picture straight?

203
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,962
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

204
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:25,169
You're the one who wants this
big change and to move in with Chandler!

205
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,395
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?

206
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,370
-It's my apartment!
-It's mine too! What else you got?

207
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,237
How about: You're moving!

208
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,422
This is ridiculous.

209
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,157
We should be packing you!

210
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,023
-Hey, how you guys doing?
-Great. Monica's moving.

211
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,593
I am not!

212
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,872
Really? How come all your
stuff is in this box?

213
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,701
Okay, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here!

214
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,177
You guys? Stop!

215
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,543
I know you're acting mad because
it'll make it easier to leave.

216
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,845
But deep down, you're really sad.
Deep, deep down.

217
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,249
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!

218
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,718
I'm just mad.

219
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,851
Then keep running.

220
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,353
You win!

221
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,624
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats...

222
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,133
a three and a six.

223
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,031
That, my friend, is "D Cup."

224
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,608
How much have you won so far?

225
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,240
-700.
-Not 700 exactly?

226
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,744
Double it.

227
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,382
In Cups, once you get $700,
you have to double it.

228
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,125
I didn't make up the rules.

229
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,130
Now, after you receive the doubling
bonus, you get one card.

230
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,995
That one card could be worth $100,
which brings your total to $1500.

231
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,965
Don't get excited, that won't happen
unless you get the.. No way!

232
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,138
This is the last box of your clothes.

233
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,340
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

234
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,347
I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

235
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,790
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...

236
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,361
I don't wanna live with
Rachel anymore.

237
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,130
You're so mean to each other.

238
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,599
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

239
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,102
That's fine because I'm not moving.

240
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,137
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

241
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,539
I said some bad stuff...

242
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,840
but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

243
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,515
Like what, Monica?

244
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,054
She has 147,000 pair of boots.

245
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,951
Good start, Mon.

246
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,684
She lets you borrow them.

247
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,063
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

248
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,396
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold!

249
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:17,173
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

250
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,632
What else?

251
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,075
When I take a shower...

252
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,573
she leaves me notes on the mirror.

253
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,044
I do. I do do that.

254
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,253
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

255
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,027
When I fall asleep on the couch...

256
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,193
she covers me with a blanket.

257
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,260
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

258
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,401
And when I told her I was gonna
move in with Chandler...

259
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,439
she was really supportive.

260
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,908
You were so great.

261
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,580
You made it so easy.

262
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,752
And now you have to leave.

263
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,725
And I have to live with a boy!

264
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,788
It's gonna be fine.

265
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,359
Now I can't wait to live with you!

266
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,362
You know what we should do?

267
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,563
Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
We'll have so much fun!

268
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,402
I think she's moving in with Chandler.

269
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,808
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?

270
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,941
Kind of.

271
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,252
Oh, my God!

272
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,664
How's the packing going?

273
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,759
Ben? He's fine. He's right..
Oh, my God!

274
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,503
Get your head out of your shirt
there, son!

275
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,469
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

276
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,419
-What's wrong?
-Ross and I were helping pack...

277
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,522
took a little break.
I lost $1500 to him in Cups!

278
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,818
How did you lose at Cups?

279
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,693
The same way you lost!

280
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:23,424
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.

281
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,369
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.

282
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,771
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup...

283
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:36,174
the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
even get half a cup! Nothing!

284
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,108
Oh, man!

285
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,875
He never played before either.

286
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,452
I think beginner's luck
is very important in Cups!

287
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,952
Let's play one more hand.
One more hand.

288
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,652
No more! I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

289
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,364
In fact, look.

290
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,395
I wanna give you something.

291
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,465
Let me give it to you before
I pawn it for Cups money.

292
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,335
I want you to have
the big, white dog...

293
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,341
as a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

294
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,914
I can't take the big white dog.
You love it.

295
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,586
It's "him." Not "it."

296
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,116
What if I bought it from you?

297
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,555
Then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

298
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,523
Say $1500?

299
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,856
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

300
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,430
You're trying to give me money again!

301
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,571
When did I try to give you money?

302
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,603
Over there with the bills!

303
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,834
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

304
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,909
We had a nice last night together.

305
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,708
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

306
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,686
Now you start with the
charity thing again!

307
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,723
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

308
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,952
I will be okay.

309
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,131
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself.

310
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,528
I'm not gonna miss you helping me
out with money.

311
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,069
The only thing I'm gonna miss...

312
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,074
is you.

313
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,301
And now the dog.

314
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,649
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.

315
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,551
I'm really gonna miss you.

316
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,631
I have your key.

317
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,730
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

318
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,570
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

319
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,581
Bye, house.

320
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,477
-She really left.
-I know.

321
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,449
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.

322
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,967
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

323
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,898
What the hell is that dog doing here?

324
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,874
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

325
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,570
-And now you want that money back?
-Exactly.

326
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,114
What kind of idiot do you
take me for?

327
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,445
It's not a real game.
I made it up.

328
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,816
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

329
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,424
At a fake game!

330
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,124
If you wanna try to
make some of it back...

331
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,494
I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

332
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,931
I am very good at Cups.

333
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,767
I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last.

334
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,477
Let's see if it comes up this time.
