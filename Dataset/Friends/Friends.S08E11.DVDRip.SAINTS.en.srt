1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Phoebe. Will you check out that guy
by the window. Wow!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,600
That guy back there? He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,440
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,360
Really?

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
What is wrong with me lately?
It's like, every guy I see.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
I mean, look at that guy, for example.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,840
That's not someone
I would be attracted to.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,000
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling..

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,240
all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants
and fanny pack.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,400
Wait a second! This is about the fourth
month of your pregnancy, right?

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,480
-Yeah.
-This is completely normal.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
Around the fourth month,
your hormones start going crazy.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,280
-Really? So this has happened to you?
-Absolutely!

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,680
And keep in mind now,
I was carrying triplets.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,840
Wow, this explains so much!

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,720
Last weekend, I went from store to store,
sitting on Santas' laps.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,760
Yeah, I remember trying
to steal a cardboard cutout..

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,840
of Evander Holyfield
from a Foot Locker.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow.
I'll ask her about this.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Maybe she can give me a pill
or something.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,800
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,160
Oh, no. Short, crazy guy recognizes me.
Worst mistake of my life.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
Call me.

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,920
I got our pictures developed
from Rockefeller Center.

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,320
Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,520
Ordinarily, I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,200
Where are the pictures that that creepy
pretzel vendor took of us together?

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, yeah.
Probably at the end.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,040
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures
of my breasts.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm missing picture time!

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,840
You know, she has a face, Ross.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,960
I didn't take these, okay? I didn't even
know my camera had a zoom lens.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,040
"Comma, officer."

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,840
-Okay, here's a good one of us.
-Wow, that is a good one!

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,760
It looks like a holiday card.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,880
With the tree in the middle
and the skaters and the snow.

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,400
Good job, pretzel pervert.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
holiday cards and I never do it.

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,320
Do you want
to send this one out together?

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,640
Together? Like, to people?

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,160
Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona
and Ross." It'll be cute, okay?

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,160
Okay.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,040
-I gotta get to work. Call me later?
-Sure, sure.

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,360
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Congratulations! You just got married!

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
I know. Can you believe that?

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,960
Married couples send out cards.
Families send out cards.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,440
People who have been dating for
a couple of months don't send out cards.

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,920
-What is she, crazy?
-That's your wife you're talking about!

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,800
No, really. I mean,
that would be like a huge step forward.

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
I like things just the way they are.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm finally in a relationship
that's not moving too fast.

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,800
You know, ordinarily,
I'd be divorced by now.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Okay, so just tell her you don't wanna
send out the card. What's she gonna do?

57
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
This.

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,960
Oh, okay. I didn't mean
to put pressure on you..

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
I just thought it would be something fun
for us to do together..

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,040
but okay, that's okay.

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,040
Okay, stop. Stop. You're right,
it's not that big a deal. I'll do the card.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,600
-What? I said I'd do it.
-I know, it's just..

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,520
Can I have $20?

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,920
-Hi. You ready for lunch?
-One second.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,600
-That's cute.
-Bing! And the Bingette!

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,360
I thought it felt a little hotter
in the office today.

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,600
-Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
-Yes. Hi.

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,880
Good news! The divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

69
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
I didn't know you and Kara divorced.
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,680
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,280
-Congratulations to you guys, though.
-No leg-chewing for us, sir.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Well, give it time.

73
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,160
So the divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
How about we all go out
to dinner tomorrow night.

75
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,760
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Why can't I think
of anything we're doing?

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by 6.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,840
They keep throwing sexual harassment
cases at me..

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,640
and I keep knocking them
out of the park!

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,880
Okay, see you tomorrow.

81
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,600
Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.

82
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,080
Honey, once you get to know him,
he's much, much worse.

83
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
I can't do this alone.

84
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,040
Honey, I'm sorry. I can't help you. I can't
spend another evening with that man.

85
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Do you remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
That's because he wasn't invited.

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,800
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,040
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

89
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,360
Oh, what the hell? B plus.

90
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,480
Hi! I went by the photo shop.
Take a look.

91
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
Here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?

92
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,080
Wow, that's great.

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,640
Do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,920
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet..

95
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,800
but I guess it's okay
to say it to other people.

96
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,920
-How many did you want? I'll get 100.
-A hundred?

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,240
Well, I guess I'll take..

98
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Mona?

99
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm not sure
about the whole card thing.

100
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
Really? Why not?

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,400
Sending out a holiday card together?

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,160
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
I didn't think of it that way.
You're right.

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,680
-So can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

105
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,600
Where are we?

106
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,320
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?

107
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,720
I love spending time with you.
I just hope we're moving forward.

108
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,120
We should talk about that,
don't you think?

109
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,520
Let's do the card!

110
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,680
-What?
-The card! I think we're there!

111
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,360
Okay. But I still think
we should have this conversation.

112
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,320
Really?

113
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,440
Even with the card?

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,520
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here
today, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

115
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,960
Oh, okay.
Can I ask you a question?

116
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Was it me, or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute?

117
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,160
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

118
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,640
Actually, never mind.
I just answered my own question.

119
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,880
-Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
-Yes, you are.

120
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,560
-Okay, now he's cute, right?
-Oh, God, yes.

121
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,080
So, how's it going?

122
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,760
It's going really good.
But enough about me! Come on.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Where are you from?
What do you do?

124
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
-I'm a doctor.
-Right. I meant..

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
in your spare time.
Do you cook? So you ski?

126
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,560
Or just hang out with your wife,
or girlfriend?

127
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,920
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend,
but I do like to ski.

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
I love to ski!
How amazing is this?

129
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,200
-Are you experiencing any discomfort?
-No, I'm very comfortable.

130
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,840
-Any painful gas?
-No!

131
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,160
Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?

132
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,680
Okay, then. Would you like
to lie down on the table?

133
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,560
Would you like me
to lie down on the table?

134
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,000
-Is there something going on here?
-Do you feel it too?

135
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,880
-Hi.
-How did your doctor's appointment go?

136
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,040
Well, let's see,
they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

137
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,240
In the middle of the exam,
I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,600
-Oh, my God!
-Why did you do that?

139
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,600
Remember that little problem I was having
during my fourth month of pregnancy?

140
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh, yeah!
The Evander Holyfield phase.

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Oh, man! You were so hard up,
you practically came on to me.

142
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,040
You wish.

143
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Hey, I could have had you
if I wanted you.

144
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,080
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

145
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,520
Okay, even this is turning me on.
You guys, I got problems.

146
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,240
Oh, hey. Hey, Ross!
How's it going with you and Mona?

147
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,600
Are you guys still together?

148
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,320
Yeah, we're moving forward.
You'll be getting our card.

149
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
You're doing a holiday card?

150
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,560
We're not just doing a card.
She also wants to have the conversation..

151
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,640
about where the relationship
is going.

152
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,760
Women!

153
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,960
I know! Why do you guys need
to have this conversation?

154
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,640
No self-respecting man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"

155
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,520
Ross, you asked me that.

156
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,440
You were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!

157
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
What are you gonna say to her?
Where is this relationship going?

158
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,920
I don't know. I really like her
and I wanna keep dating her.

159
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,240
-So tell her that.
-No, I can't.

160
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,360
Because then she's gonna say,
"Well, it's not moving anywhere..

161
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,480
-then we should just break up."
-Yeah, that's true.

162
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,120
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them. Really.

163
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture..

164
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,480
something that says we're moving
forward without having to talk about it.

165
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,080
Like asking her
to move in with you?

166
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Smaller than that.

167
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,800
-Making her a mix tape?
-Bigger than that.

168
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,840
-Give her a key to your apartment.
-We were closer with the mix tape.

169
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Have you said, "I love you"?
You could say, "I love you."

170
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,480
I don't think I'm quite there yet.

171
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,080
But I could say,
"I love spending time with you."

172
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,800
-We hate that.
-That is a slap in the face.

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,680
Forget it. You know what?
I'll just have the conversation.

174
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll just say I like things the way
they are, and hope for the best.

175
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,080
What do you think, Rach?

176
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
I think if it was
a little colder in here..

177
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
I could see your nipples
through that sweater.

178
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,880
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

179
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,600
As it turns out, we can't do it.
Monica has to work.

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,280
My ex-wife didn't work.

181
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,840
Unless you call turning
into her mother "work."

182
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,360
Fine. Tomorrow night then.

183
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
-Tomorrow's no good for her, either.
-Why not?

184
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
It's the semifinals..

185
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,600
of her bocce ball tournament.

186
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,800
Okay. The night after that then.

187
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,480
Well, that's the finals, and I think
she's gonna go all the way, sir.

188
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,360
What's going on, Bing? Does your wife
have a problem with me or something?

189
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,080
Well, now you're just talking crazy.

190
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,960
Then why can't the three of us
go out together?

191
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,160
Because we split up.

192
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,400
Monica and I split up.

193
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,480
Hold me.

194
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,240
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.

195
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,400
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.

196
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
And the way she looked at me,
pure lust.

197
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,760
What would really help me through
this tough time is choking someone.

198
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,960
I know how you feel. Oh, yeah.

199
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,240
I know what it's like to give a woman
all your love..

200
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,960
and then have that love
thrown back in your face.

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,320
And then the court decides to give you
custody of those fat, left-handed twins.

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,360
Well, they're lucky to have you, sir.

203
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,040
Bing, my boy,
we're gonna get you over this.

204
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,720
Here's the plan: Grab your coat,
we're going to a strip club!

205
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
Oh, no!
Monica would freak.

206
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,200
But to hell with that bitch!

207
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
Here we go.

208
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,880
Mona, it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.

209
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

210
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,360
We are so..

211
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,800
Well, I really like you.
And I love hanging out with you.

212
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,080
And I'm having a lot of fun.

213
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

214
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,800
There's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.

215
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,000
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

216
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,200
So where is it going?

217
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,880
That's the real question.

218
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,800
And the answer is..

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,400
it's going somewhere..

220
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,800
fun.

221
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,880
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

222
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,400
But you're not getting any younger.

223
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,200
No! I mean, not you.
Not you.

224
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You are getting younger!

225
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,760
You're getting younger by the second.
What's your secret?

226
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm sorry, so where are we?

227
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Well, to sum up..

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,080
we're having fun.
You look young.

229
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,440
-Okay..
-But that's not enough.

230
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,400
So..

231
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,840
here's a key to my apartment.

232
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,920
-Really?
-Really.

233
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,040
You don't think this is too fast?

234
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,320
You gave her a key
to your apartment?

235
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,040
Not just a key.
I gave her the only key!

236
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,800
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship!

237
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,240
-Why did you give her a key?
-She talked me into a corner, okay?

238
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,840
She's like this conversational wizard.

239
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,840
So you had the conversation
you didn't wanna have..

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,760
and you made the gesture
you didn't wanna make.

241
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,040
Did I start this by saying, "Hey,
I did something awesome today"?

242
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,280
-Do either of you have a key to my place?
-I don't think you've ever given us keys.

243
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,120
Yeah, why would I? It's my home.

244
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,720
-Ross, how did the conversation go?
-Great. I live on the street.

245
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,920
Where?

246
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,760
-Hi.
-Okay, Monica, Rachel..

247
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,600
-this is my friend Roger.
-Hi, Roger.

248
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,600
I'll get us some drinks.
Could you help me?

249
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,120
Yeah, okay.

250
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,840
He's here to have sex with you.

251
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,720
-What?
-You're welcome.

252
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,240
-Phoebe, no!
-It's okay. He's a virgin.

253
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,360
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
I think he'll have sex with you.

254
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's leave these two alone.

255
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,560
No! I don't care what my hormones are
doing! I won't do it with some random guy!

256
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,760
Fine! Then you tell Roger, because
he was really looking forward to this!

257
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,160
Bing! Look at those twin sisters
dancing together.

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,160
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls.

259
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,480
That's all right, sir.
And that's just one girl.

260
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,600
-Bing, what's this?
-It's a hand.

261
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a thing you use
as a Jack and Coke holder.

262
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,120
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.
We'll throw it in the East River!

263
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,680
-No!
-Yes!

264
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,680
I did it, and I felt a lot better! You
might even hit a seagull in the head.

265
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch
of extra keys.

266
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,480
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,240
Ross, what's going on?
You're changing the lock?

268
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,720
No.

269
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,760
That guy is.

270
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
You give me a key to your apartment,
and then you change the lock?

271
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
Good luck, buddy.

272
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,800
I thought we were moving forward. Now
you're sending me all these mixed signals.

273
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,800
What are you trying to tell me?

274
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,440
I'm trying to tell you..

275
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,880
I made you a mix tape.

276
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,720
-What?
-I love you.

277
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,040
And I love spending time with you.

278
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,240
-Hi, honey, I'm home.
-From the tequila factory?

279
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,480
It was awful.

280
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,840
To get out of going to dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.

281
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,880
So then he took me to these strip clubs
and sleazy bars.

282
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,680
When I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.

283
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,880
Come here.
I can breathe through my mouth.

284
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,040
-Oh, sweetie.
-You know what the worst part was?

285
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
I got to see what my life
would be like without you.

286
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,960
It was like It's a Wonderful Life
with lap dances.

287
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,640
Please promise me
that you'll never leave me..

288
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,400
that we'll grow old together, and be
with each other for the rest of our lives.

289
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,280
I promise.

290
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Speaking of together, how about
we send out a holiday card this year?

291
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,600
I don't know if we're there yet.

292
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?

293
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

294
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,560
-I'll call you back.
-Who was that?

295
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,840
-It's just the pizza place.
-You hung up on the pizza place?

296
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,920
I don't hang up on your friends.

297
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,440
-Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
-What's wrong?

298
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,680
-You don't want to hear about it.
-Then why did I ask?

299
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,640
Okay, this is really embarrassing, but
lately, with this whole pregnancy thing..

300
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm just finding myself..

301
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,600
How do I put this?

302
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,480
Erotically charged.

303
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,160
Is that college talk for "horny"?

304
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
and I don't know what to do about them.

305
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I can't date like a normal person, which is
fine because I don't need a relationship.

306
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,920
All I really want is one great night!
Just sex.

307
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,680
No strings attached.
No relationship.

308
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,240
With someone I feel comfortable with,
and who knows what he's doing.

309
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,880
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard..

310
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,360
to find?

311
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,920
So how was your day?

312
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,240
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

313
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Well, I gotta get up early,
and it's almost 7:00.

314
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
-I gotta go to my room.
-Good night!

315
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,400
Good night!

316
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,520
-I can't do it!
-I didn't ask you to do it!

317
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
-You're Rachel!
-You're Joey!

318
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,880
-You're my friend!
-Right back at you.

319
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,200
Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong,
and weird and bad!

320
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,160
So bad! But I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't ask you to do anything!

321
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,960
I know!

322
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,960
-You wanna do it?
-No!

323
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,840
-I'm just testing you!
-Well, that's the end of this conversation!

324
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
-This conversation never happened!
-Never happened!

325
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,640
-Good night!
-Good night!

326
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,040
Get back in there!

327
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,160
Listen, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.

328
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,080
It really wasn't right.
And I want to make it up to you.

329
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,240
So I brought you something
I think you'll really enjoy.

330
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,720
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.

331
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm gonna go now.

332
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,560
I'm sorry.
I thought I could do it, and I can't.
