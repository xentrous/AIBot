1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,001
She is the star of the play,
and she is my girlfriend.

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,869
I get to have sex with the star
of the play!

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,777
-People can hear you.
-I know!

4
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,513
She looks great, doesn't she?

5
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,356
That is one good-looking man.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,234
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

7
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,034
So you been doing this long?

8
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:45,573
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,411
That's nice.

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,517
Dude!

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,253
-Is that an expensive blouse?
-If you want it to be.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,695
Here's your girlfriend's button.

13
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,205
The One with Rachel's Crush

14
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,790
Do you still have your old blouses
and dresses from high school?

15
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,926
Yeah, I think I have some around
here somewhere. Why?

16
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,287
Maternity clothes are so expensive.

17
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,933
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.
If you could just...

18
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,872
...throw your purses at it.

19
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,772
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

20
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,176
Are you out of a job?

21
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,112
No, but they stuck me in Personal
Shopping, which is a huge step down.

22
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,341
What is that?

23
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,715
Where you walk around with rich people
and tell them what to buy?

24
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,022
That sounds great!

25
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:49,400
We switched apartments. You can't eat
our food. That gravy train has ended.

26
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,493
There's gravy?

27
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,072
If you have the big apartment, you
have to deal with people coming over.

28
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,837
That fridge has to be stocked.
That's your apartment now.

29
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,347
-What are you doing?
-I think I left a doughnut up here.

30
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,624
How was Kathy's play?

31
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:20,092
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex
with a real good-looking guy.

32
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,295
It's like somebody wrote down
my worst nightmare...

33
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,470
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,701
That's a good idea for a business.

35
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,878
I'm totally screwed. They're gonna be
hot and heavy on stage every night...

36
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,913
...then they'll go to their cast parties,
and he's gonna try to undermine me.

37
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,609
He'll be like, "Where's your boyfriend?
What's his name? Chester?"

38
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,153
She'll go, "It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever!"

39
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,387
That is a good trick.

40
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,058
All right, look.
What am I going to do?

41
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,235
They're actors.
They're there to do a job.

42
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,767
It doesn't mean they're
gonna get together.

43
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,840
Just because it happened with
Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

44
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,068
...doesn't mean it's gonna
happen with them.

45
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,278
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,507
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

47
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,313
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

48
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,680
They're not a couple.

49
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,653
I get the game now.

50
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,753
All these people were in movies together.
It's much different with plays.

51
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,661
You were in acting class
together, and she slept with you.

52
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,031
Acting class is a lot more
like a movie than a play.

53
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,538
When they were doing it on stage,
was it really hot?

54
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,004
Oh, yeah.

55
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,908
So you're fine.

56
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,413
The rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...

57
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,815
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.

58
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,320
As long as it's hot on stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

59
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,086
When the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

60
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,185
Really?

61
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,300
You guys have been to every play I've been
in. Have I ever had chemistry on stage?

62
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,730
-No.
-No!

63
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,735
Are you gonna go see
the play with me tonight?

64
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:17,144
I don't know how comfortable I am going
to see how hot the sex is between them.

65
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,750
-I know, but
-No, I'm there.

66
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,150
-Want some pancakes?
-You made pancakes?

67
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,690
Grab a plate.

68
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,962
No, no. Stay right there.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,391
Getting closer.

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,162
Don't worry...

71
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,306
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles and...

72
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:46,240
...jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm sure are the same thing.

73
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,079
Please eat, because Joey
opened everything.

74
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:55,379
We're watching the game here Saturday
night, if people wanna come over.

75
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,580
I was thinking about having people over.

76
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,758
Yeah? Who's playing?

77
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,919
The players.

78
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,731
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

79
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,833
Please. It's a relief, is what
it is, is what it is.

80
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,472
Pheebs, stick out your plate.

81
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,642
Monica, I'm quitting.

82
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,152
I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

83
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,389
I'm quitting.

84
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,093
I'm talking to my boss right now.

85
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,295
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

86
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,761
Okay, bye. Call me when you
get this message.

87
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,735
Mr. Waltham?
I really need to talk to you.

88
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,597
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.

89
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,171
And you have a customer.

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,003
Hi.

91
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,441
Hi, I'm Joshua.

92
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,207
I'm Rachel Greene.
What could I do for you, Joshua?

93
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,353
I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife
Well, my ex-wife

94
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,250
I'm so sorry.

95
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,756
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.

96
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,833
I got away with this suit
and what turned out to be a skirt.

97
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,004
Well, at least that's a great suit.

98
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,733
It wasn't much fun dropping
it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

99
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,780
I need everything down to underwear.
If you're willing, I'm all yours.

100
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,380
Okay.

101
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,180
You needed to speak to me?

102
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,117
No, no, that wasn't me.

103
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,827
We should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

104
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,692
The selection of underwear
that we carry.

105
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,661
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,239
-It's this way.
-This way? Sorry.

107
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,709
I'm right. Right? There was
no chemistry between them.

108
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,544
Before, they had heat.
Now, there's no heat.

109
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,513
You know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.

110
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,489
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
There was some sexual chemistry.

111
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,855
Come on.
It was like cousins having sex.

112
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:25,334
Here she comes. Don't say a word.
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.

113
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,237
Hey, you guys!

114
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,210
Thank you so much for coming again.

115
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,242
-Did you like it tonight?
-Absolutely.

116
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,241
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

117
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,684
It's a good play, isn't it?

118
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,289
I loved the play.
You were great.

119
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,395
And Nick, ditto.

120
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,727
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

121
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,999
Okay...

122
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,943
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

123
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,943
It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.

124
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:16,411
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?

125
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,792
I can see how this could happen. You're up
there every night naked, touching, kissing.

126
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,029
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

127
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,597
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?

128
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,070
You can understand,
given how we started.

129
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,034
I can't believe you're
throwing that in my face.

130
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,368
That is what happened.
I don't even see you denying this.

131
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,439
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
You call me when you grow up.

132
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,846
Don't expect that to happen
any time soon!

133
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,624
I have the best job
in the entire world!

134
00:09:54,927 --> 00:10:00,024
The most adorable guy came over,
and I got to dress him up all day!

135
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,663
Rachel has a new doll!

136
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,002
I wish he was a doll. I'd get a Rachel
doll and bump them together...

137
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,401
...and make kissing noises.

138
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,671
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.

139
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,209
Joshua.

140
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,780
Joshua. Josh.

141
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,847
Hello?

142
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,282
Hi.

143
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,952
What do I smell?

144
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,383
I don't know. It smells good.

145
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,393
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.

146
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,865
Please, have some.

147
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,471
I've been fiddling around here,
making delicious treats for everyone.

148
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,141
The new Playboy.

149
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,142
Just something I picked up.

150
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,578
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever!

151
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,545
What?

152
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:03,457
It's just something Joshua said about
V-necks, but you had to be there.

153
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,157
How does Jason look in a V-neck?

154
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,094
-It's Joshua.
-Whatever.

155
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,533
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout!

156
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,504
-Hate to eat and run.
-No, wait. Please, don't go!

157
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,003
I've got porn for you too.

158
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,942
I don't need it.

159
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,610
People are supposed to want
to hang out here.

160
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,649
Why? What is the big deal?

161
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,253
I'm the hostess.

162
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,287
Not those guys.
I'm always the hostess.

163
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,690
Even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

164
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,089
I served the best air.

165
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,099
Why'd you make a big thing out of everyone
hanging out in the big apartment?

166
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,273
'Cause they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

167
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,374
I'm done now. They've suffered enough.

168
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,972
If you wanted to punish them, you should
have just made them hang out here.

169
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,479
That is true.

170
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,515
This place is gonna be 10 times
better than that place.

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,847
Are we gonna
trash their place?

172
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,385
There's steps!

173
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,689
Slut!

174
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,969
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!

175
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,832
-What?
-You were right?

176
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,668
I confronted her,
and she didn't deny it.

177
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,811
I don't live here!

178
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,975
Wait, are you sure?

179
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,017
I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

180
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,190
Then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's...

181
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,489
-Beefsteak Charlie's?
-Yes!

182
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,858
You and I
have always been like:

183
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,193
Man, I am so sorry.

184
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,271
The bartender taught me
a trick, though.

185
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,847
I don't remember it.

186
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,367
-Do you need help with that?
-I got it.

187
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,664
I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

188
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:35,302
I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

189
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,972
-Just so frustrating.
-Why don't you ask him out?

190
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,685
Totally. That's such a turn-on.

191
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,348
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

192
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,853
That's the turn-on.

193
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,487
He just got a divorce. Right?
He's probably really nervous around women.

194
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,924
Maybe you just need to
make the first move.

195
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,862
-I've never asked a guy out before.
-You've never asked a guy out?

196
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,093
No. Have you?

197
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,338
Thousands of times!

198
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,908
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

199
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,408
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,275
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down, and I say...

201
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,351
..."Hey. How you doing?"

202
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,948
Oh, please!

203
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,183
Hey. How you doing?

204
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:31,692
You know what? I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna call him up and ask him out.

205
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,667
I can do that, ask him out.

206
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,931
"How you doing?"

207
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,012
Hi, Joshua.
It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.

208
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,382
I was just wondering if you...?

209
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,315
If you...

210
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,749
...left your wallet
at the store today?

211
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,089
We found a wallet, and we

212
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,157
The license? That is a good idea.

213
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,272
Well, let's see.
This license belongs to...

214
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,500
...belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

215
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,643
So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

216
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,821
-You've done that a thousand times?
-I've never done that.

217
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,992
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.

218
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,459
You gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like...

219
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,565
...Knicks tickets. Invite him to a Knicks
game. You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

220
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,963
-Really? You think that'll work?
-Absolutely. And if not, can I go?

221
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,538
What the heck is that?

222
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,986
Did she call?

223
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,353
No. Sorry.

224
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,588
Maybe I should call her.

225
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,198
Forget her, man. You don't need her.

226
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,891
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

227
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,003
Well, yeah, but, you know,
what if I was wrong?

228
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,873
How might you be wrong?

229
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,277
What if she didn't actually
sleep with the guy?

230
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,935
Tell me she told you this.

231
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,274
She didn't have to tell me.
I saw the play. There was no heat.

232
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,577
-Back me up.
-That's all you're basing this on?

233
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,549
That's not backing me up!

234
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,313
Look, you said,
"With the offstage and the heat"

235
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,891
That was just a theory. There's a lot
of theories that didn't pan out:

236
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:41,656
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

237
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,559
Oh, my God!

238
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,570
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with?"

239
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,605
"It's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets"

240
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,113
"Who likes the Knick?"

241
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,520
What do you think?

242
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,287
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

243
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,424
...I think you look great.

244
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,363
Oh, yeah. You look great.

245
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,743
This looks great.

246
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,636
So you like it?

247
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,146
I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'll wear it home.

248
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,253
-Great.
-Thank you so much for all your help.

249
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,018
Well, I guess this is it.

250
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,719
Thanks.

251
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,826
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
for the bathing suits.

252
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,192
You don't want to do that now?

253
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,963
That's okay.

254
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,931
I'll see you around sometime.

255
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,667
Basketball!

256
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,403
Sorry?

257
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,671
I have two tickets to the
Knicks game if you're interested...

258
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,315
...just as a thank-you for this week.

259
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,181
That would be great!

260
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,481
-Really?
-That would be fantastic!

261
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,318
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!

262
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,063
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

263
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,561
Good morning.

264
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,111
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

265
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,079
I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

266
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,980
I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

267
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,481
I really wish you'd called me.

268
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,522
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

269
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,094
I think this is a good thing.

270
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,856
We've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

271
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,902
I know for me, but

272
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,170
Nick's pants?

273
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,080
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one!

274
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,784
-For next time, what do you say?
-"I have an extra ticket."

275
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,190
"An extra ticket."
Not "two tickets."

276
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,163
The first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

277
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,241
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.

278
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,444
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.

279
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,944
Okay, it's ready.

280
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,649
-Come on.
-What's ready?

281
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,079
Just come.

282
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,185
Oh, my God!

283
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,823
This is beautiful!

284
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,865
Did you work for two days straight?

285
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,329
Pretty much.

286
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,970
What do you think of the floor?

287
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,336
I don't know.
Looks the same.

288
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,569
You used to have carpet.

289
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,209
Oh, yeah.

290
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,477
I made snacks.

291
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,980
Please, just hang out.

292
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,119
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

293
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,554
Do you want us to come back later?

294
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,889
No, no, no. Stay.
Just keep talking.

295
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm always the hostess.

296
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,434
How'd it go?

297
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,901
-She wasn't sleeping with him.
-Good!

298
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,241
She is now.

299
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:51,675
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

300
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:56,086
You think you know a person, then they
turn around and sleep with Nick.

301
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,587
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

302
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,592
I hate him.
And I hate her.

303
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,528
I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault.

304
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,795
How? How is it your fault?

305
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,098
I should have called.

306
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,832
If I had called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick.

307
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,707
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his man-nipples!

308
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,776
This is not your fault.

309
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,480
Your fight does not
justify her sleeping with someone.

310
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,858
Well, if she thought
they were on a break...

311
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:48,636
Rachel, one of your customers seems to
have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.

312
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,899
Really?

313
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:54,068
-Will you call him?
-Yes, I will. Absolutely.

314
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,023
Hello, Rachel.

315
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,196
Hi, Joshua.

316
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,197
-I left my wallet here on purpose.
-Really?

317
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,631
Yes. I just wanted to see you again.

318
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,701
I'm glad.

319
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,309
Rachel, I'd like to say
something to you.

320
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,005
Yes?

321
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,670
"How you doing?"
