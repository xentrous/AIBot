1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,466
All right, they got water,
orange juice...

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,231
...and what looks like cider.

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,774
Taste it.

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,438
Yeah, it's fat.
I drank fat!

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,209
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

6
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,523
Hey, Mr. Tux.

7
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,353
- Why aren't you dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,758
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 7:40.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,593
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us
two minutes to get dressed.

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,963
I'd feel better if you
got dressed now.

11
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

12
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,734
Oh, look at you. All sexy.

13
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,912
Really?

14
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:57,951
- How come you didn't come over earlier?
- Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,558
- Hey, Ross, want some cider?
- No.

16
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,825
So you're pretty close, huh?

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,523
- Makeup's on. Hair's done.
- I just have to get dressed.

18
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,565
And that takes what,
six or seven minutes?

19
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,271
Yeah. Once I figure out
what I'm wearing.

20
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,237
Glass of fat?

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,814
The One Where No One's Ready

22
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,428
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?

23
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,062
Nope.

24
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,000
- You wanna hear it?
- Am I in it?

25
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,405
After I thank everyone
for giving to the museum...

26
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,407
...I sing a song about
the wonder that is Joey.

27
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,076
Hello! You look great!

28
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,479
Thank you. I know, though.

29
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:41,184
You see this? This is a person
who is ready to go.

30
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,361
Phoebe, you...

31
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,954
You are my star.

32
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,566
Well, you're my lucky penny.

33
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:55,433
All right, I took the quiz. And it
turns out I do put career before men.

34
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,739
Get up.

35
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,106
What?

36
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,874
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

37
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,254
- Because I was sitting there.
- But you left.

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,381
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

39
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,626
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,592
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!

41
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,392
The big deal is I was
sitting there last! So...

42
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,931
...it's my seat.

43
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:28,634
Well, actually, the last place
you were sitting was in there, so...

44
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,700
You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

45
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:36,472
You both have to go get dressed before
the big vein in my head pops.

46
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,479
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.

47
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,878
Get up!

48
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,187
Phoebe, you look great!

49
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,623
All right already.

50
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,427
Are you gonna do magic?

51
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,832
That's funny. Change.

52
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,866
- I just got in.
- I don't care.

53
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:03,040
- It starts at 8. We can't be late.
- He could not, would not, want to wait.

54
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,506
Our table is in front.
My boss will be there.

55
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,281
Everyone will see if we arrive
after it starts.

56
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,382
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

57
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,786
Does this look like something a
paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

58
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,481
I don't know.
You might be the first one.

59
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,057
- Rach, did you check the machine?
- No.

60
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,461
Wait. This is the outfit that makes
my calves look fat. Never mind.

61
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,137
Well, Joey, I wrote
a little song today.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,074
It's called, "Get up!"

63
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,670
I wish there was something
I could do to help you.

64
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,646
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

65
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,479
All right. You can have the chair.

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,985
- Really?
- Oh, my. Would you look at that?

67
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,528
It's me, I'm coming over.

68
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,356
What if I'm already there
when you play this message?

69
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,532
Is that too spooky?

70
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,069
Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me. Pick up.

71
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,538
Rachel? Rach?

72
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,333
What?

73
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,837
Never mind.

74
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,737
Hi, Rach, it's your sister.

75
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,577
Did you ever sleep with Donnie Mazzio
because last night he kept shouting:

76
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,777
"Two for two."

77
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,555
Do you want me to get dressed
or hear a long story about a hayride?

78
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,058
Are you only asking him because...

79
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,063
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

80
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,407
Is that message old or new?

81
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,168
Old or new? Old or new?

82
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,346
It's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?

83
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,847
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.

84
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,849
It could be important.
Shouldn't I call him back?

85
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,488
Honey, you did call him back.
It's old.

86
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,783
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

87
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,119
When Carol and I broke up...

88
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,421
...I went through the same thing.
You know what I did?

89
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,656
I got dressed.

90
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,170
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

91
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,397
There we go. There we go.

92
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,609
You know what? Don't get up.
Just sit there.

93
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,903
I just hope you don't mind
my hand right here.

94
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,480
Not touching. Can't get mad!
Not touching. Can't get mad!

95
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,881
Not touching. Can't get mad!

96
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,521
Oh, my God!
You rotten boys!

97
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,960
- Sorry, Phoebe.
- What am I gonna do?

98
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:41,190
Don't rub it! What gets out hummus?
What gets out hummus?

99
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,460
Monica!
What gets out hummus?

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,270
If it is a new message,
what is he calling to say?

101
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,007
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

102
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,810
Maybe he called to
say you're obsessive.

103
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,073
- So should I call him back?
- No!

104
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,507
No!

105
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,188
Okay, do these match?

106
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,552
- Yes, they definitely match.
- They don't match.

107
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,030
What? They didn't match.

108
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,929
- Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
- Fine with me.

109
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,204
I am so comfortable.

110
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,410
Me too.

111
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,372
In fact, I think I might
be a little too comfortable.

112
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,276
All right.

113
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,012
Okay, we have 19 minutes.
I want you to go and change.

114
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,453
When you come back, Joey will go
change and he'll have vacated the chair.

115
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,917
- Okay.
- All right.

116
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,957
Fine. I'm going.

117
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,564
When I get back, it's Chair City.
And I'm the guy...

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,495
...who's sitting in a chair!

119
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,934
Is this a little too...?

120
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,367
Pheebs? What happened?

121
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,906
I got the hummus.

122
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:01,045
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,441
- It won't go with this dress.
- You're right.

124
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,152
- Well, let's just get you out of that.
- No, no, no. Not "out of that."

125
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,551
- Not out of clothes.
- Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

126
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,019
I called him.

127
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,987
Yes. I got his machine
and I left a message.

128
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,696
But it's okay. It's okay...

129
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,128
...because it was, like,
a casual, breezy message.

130
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,424
It was breezy.

131
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,338
God, what if it wasn't breezy?

132
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,873
How could it not be breezy? No.
Because you're in such a breezy place.

133
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,911
I got it. I will play my message and
you can tell me if it's breezy enough.

134
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,140
But how you gonna do that?

135
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,152
I know the code
to his answering machine.

136
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,911
Okay, Mon, I really don't think
this is the...

137
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,886
Okay, you're dialing.
You are dialing.

138
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,001
- What's going on?
- Monica's beeping into Richard's machine.

139
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,435
Is she crazy?

140
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,473
Like a straw.

141
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,212
Remember? Crazy straws?

142
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,214
Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.

143
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,080
You have two new messages.

144
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,949
Wow, what a cool job.

145
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,190
You have two new messages.

146
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,359
Please pass the pie.

147
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,758
Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking
in because I got a message...

148
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:34,065
...from you and didn't know
if it was old or new. So I'm checking.

149
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,899
So let me know.

150
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,540
Or don't. Whatever.

151
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,335
I'm breezy!

152
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,171
You can't say you're breezy.
That negates the breezy.

153
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,944
Hola. It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.

154
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,716
Call me about this weekend, okay?

155
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,253
Now, she sounded breezy.

156
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,139
He's seeing someone.
I can't believe he's seeing someone.

157
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,867
- You don't know that.
- Well, whose voice was that?

158
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,080
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.

159
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,418
Michelle. Of course! It was Michelle.
Did it sound like Michelle?

160
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,815
I cannot remember her.

161
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,057
Great. It's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.

162
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,763
It was Michelle.

163
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,692
It was definitely Michelle.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,164
Try Monica's green dress. If it
doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

165
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,133
- Unless I wear it.
- You don't know what you're wearing?

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,002
I'm just trying to look nice
for your big night.

167
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,338
Which we have
to leave for in 12 minutes.

168
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,571
I'll pick something out for you.

169
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,377
- There! There! That looks good.
- Ross, that's a towel!

170
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,516
You will notice that I am fully dressed.

171
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,056
I, in turn, have noticed
that you are not.

172
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:06,162
So in the words of A.A. Milne,
"Get out of my chair, dill-hole."

173
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,965
Okay.

174
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,271
- What are you doing?
- You said to give you the chair.

175
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,605
You didn't say anything about cushions.

176
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,544
They're the essence
of the chair!

177
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,310
That's right! I'm taking the essence.

178
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,251
Oh, he'll be back.

179
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,889
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

180
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,189
- I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
- That was a Halloween costume.

181
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,796
Unless you would like me to go
as Little Bo Peep.

182
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,031
I didn't recognize it
without that inflatable sheep.

183
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,002
Which, by the way, Chandler,
I would like back one of these days.

184
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,270
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this
perfect for me?

185
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,014
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

186
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,446
Of course, not for tonight.
Hi. I'm going to a benefit.

187
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,880
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?

188
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,319
No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
I love you. Breathe.

189
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,728
We used them as pillows
when we went camping.

190
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,929
What?

191
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,363
The sheep.

192
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,468
Hey, what you do on your own time...

193
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,836
Where's my underwear?

194
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,270
- Come on, you took his underwear?
- He took my essence!

195
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,349
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear
the underwear you're wearing now?

196
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,179
Because I'm not wearing
any underwear now.

197
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,779
Why do you have
to wear underwear tonight?

198
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,652
It's a rented tux, okay?

199
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,327
I'm not gonna go commando
in another man's fatigues.

200
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,160
Then somebody's gonna have
to give somebody back his cushions.

201
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,170
Okay. You hide my clothes, I'm gonna
do the exact opposite to you.

202
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,675
What, are you gonna
show me my clothes?

203
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,108
Hey, opposite...

204
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,309
...is opposite.

205
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,776
He's got nothing!

206
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,550
Okay, I'm ready.

207
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,689
Rachel didn't have anything
I liked but this ribbon.

208
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,559
I thought, all right,
I'll be political.

209
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,195
- What are you supporting?
- Christmas.

210
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,710
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,
and I have exactly 12 minutes...

211
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,079
What?

212
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,745
My watch stopped.
My watch. Okay, see...

213
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,113
...the dinosaur tail
isn't going around anymore.

214
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,718
What time is it? It's 7:33. I have
seven minutes. I have seven minutes!

215
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,723
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?

216
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,427
- Just pick one, okay?
- Oh, okay, okay. The black.

217
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,224
Do you have black
with little strappies?

218
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,529
Yeah. But those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.

219
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:03,640
Yeah, pants! What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.

220
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,937
I don't know what you're doing,
but just get in there...

221
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,680
...and pick out any shoes
that fit your feet.

222
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,316
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make...

223
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:18,182
...your ankles or your knees or your
earlobes look fat. Just do it!

224
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,052
Go in there, pick something out
so we can go.

225
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,364
- All right.
- Thank you.

226
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,929
I've got to call Michelle to see
if that was her voice.

227
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,103
It was. It was her voice.

228
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,331
Monica, I think you've gone over
to the bad place.

229
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,209
Hola.

230
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,845
Hello? Hello?

231
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,278
- Okay. That was her, right?
- Definitely. Yeah.

232
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,146
So there you go.

233
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,889
We're out of the woods.
I think I'll get dressed now.

234
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,191
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

235
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,965
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

236
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,492
Yeah, just a second.
Can I ask who's calling?

237
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,170
It's Michelle!

238
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,243
She must have that caller ID thing.
You should get that.

239
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,373
Michelle?

240
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,748
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.

241
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,112
Just try to be...

242
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,555
You're so sweet.

243
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,351
Yeah, we were a great couple.

244
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,494
I know, I really miss him.

245
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,724
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that...

246
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,594
You know what's weird?

247
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,628
Donald Duck never wore pants.

248
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,938
But when he gets
out of the shower...

249
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,802
...he always puts a towel
around his waist.

250
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,312
I mean, what is that about?

251
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,845
I only beeped in so I could hear my
own message. I mean, that's allowed.

252
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,858
I would really appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell your dad about...

253
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,532
What do you mean, you don't feel
comfortable with this? We're friends!

254
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,702
That bitch always hated me.

255
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,335
I'm calling her back.

256
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,336
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

257
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,976
- She's got a phone in there, right?
- Okay, we're on it.

258
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,654
I know it says "black tie optional"...

259
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,557
...but this may be pushing it a little.

260
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,659
I'm not gonna go.

261
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,063
You're not gonna go?

262
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,000
No, I think I'm gonna catch up
on my correspondence.

263
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,502
How can you not be going?

264
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,375
I'm not gonna go.

265
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,310
So I think that will accomplish
the not going.

266
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,724
You know, just out of curiosity...

267
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,190
Since I was humiliated
and yelled at in front of my friends...

268
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:15,195
...I'm just, I don't know, not in a
very museum benefity kind of mood.

269
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,360
Right. Well, okay. Okay.
God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

270
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,766
- That's fine.
- No, but you're mad.

271
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,974
I'm not mad. I'm just not going.

272
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,676
- Right.
- Okay.

273
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,038
You know that I have to go, right?

274
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:34,684
So is it gonna be, like,
I'm abandoning you while you're upset?

275
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,854
- No.
- No?

276
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,217
- You're not upset about the yelling.
- Right. And the humiliating.

277
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,519
Well, of course, the humiliating.

278
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,585
So we...

279
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,323
...we're okay?

280
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,590
- We're good.
- Right.

281
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,233
- Honey? I love you.
- Yes, Ross.

282
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,573
Get away from the phone!

283
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,148
She's just getting dressed now.

284
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,583
Is it wrong that I was
totally aroused by that?

285
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,029
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

286
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,300
You hide my clothes,
I'm wearing everything you own.

287
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,429
Oh, my God!

288
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,873
That is so not the opposite
of taking somebody's underwear!

289
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,601
Look at me! I'm Chandler.

290
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,747
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

291
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,751
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...

292
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,021
It's hot with all this stuff on.

293
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,818
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

294
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,965
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.

295
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,829
I'm sick of this.
I've had it up to here.

296
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,572
Neither of you can come to the party!

297
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,734
Jeez, what a baby!

298
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,474
Way to ruin it.
I was gonna go get dressed.

299
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,943
The only person
I cared about getting dressed...

300
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,581
...is the person who's
not even gonna go.

301
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,682
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?

302
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,447
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.

303
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,523
I need you there.

304
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,363
What can I do to show you
how much I want you to be there?

305
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,299
You could drink the fat.

306
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,498
Welcome to an adult conversation.

307
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,204
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

308
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,309
- That actually sounds interesting.
- What?

309
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,743
I think you should drink the fat.

310
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,188
Okay, if that's what it takes to
show you how much you mean to me...

311
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,055
...and how much I want you there,
that's what I'll do.

312
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,493
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.

313
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,297
I think this will be fine.

314
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,862
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake...

315
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,936
...with chicken bits floating in it.

316
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,679
Cheers.

317
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.

318
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,641
You will?

319
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,777
- You were really gonna do that.
- Well, yeah.

320
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,016
You were gonna drink the fat.

321
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,063
Let's see what else he'll do!

322
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,298
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.

323
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,800
I'll get a cab. I want everyone
downstairs in two minutes.

324
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,130
Monica!

325
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,104
Stop it. Stop it!

326
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,241
Ross went to get a cab, so we...

327
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,075
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

328
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,854
Hi, this is Richard.

329
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,249
You have three new messages.

330
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,852
Not anymore.

331
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,690
Message erased.

332
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,668
To record your message,
begin speaking at the tone.

333
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,808
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

334
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,010
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

335
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,146
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

336
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,185
I beeped into your machine and I heard
this message that freaked me out...

337
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,653
You know what?
Michelle will tell you the rest.

338
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:37,386
I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we
can just forget the whole thing.

339
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,963
Your outgoing message
has now been changed.

340
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,004
Outgoing?

341
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,138
Did that say outgoing?
Not outgoing!

342
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,242
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

343
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,538
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

344
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,310
Maybe I'm getting
my period or something.

345
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,987
- How did you do that?
- I don't know!

346
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,655
- Goodbye.
- No!

347
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,661
Okay. Okay. Okay, I've got two
cabs and no people! Go, go, go!

348
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,027
Maybe we can call the phone company
to change the message?

349
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,563
They could change his number.

350
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,432
I think after this,
he'll be doing that himself.

351
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,830
Rachel!

352
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,341
You...
You look...

353
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,980
And I still have about
five seconds to spare.

354
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,658
- That was about seven seconds.
- So we're a little late.

355
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,595
Come on.

356
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,536
- Oh, and by the way...
- What?

357
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,705
I'm going commando too.

358
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,947
So I said, "Who are you
Cro-Magnum P.I.?"

359
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,148
Dr. Geller?

360
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:18,057
- Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
- What a pleasure.

361
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:22,893
I was quite impressed with your
paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

362
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,626
Yes. It confirmed everything
I'd written.

363
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,065
Excuse me.

364
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,432
Hi.

365
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,937
Yes?

366
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,111
Well, you're kind of sitting in my seat.

367
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,970
What do you mean, your seat?

368
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,347
- I mean, I was sitting there.
- But you got up.

369
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,744
But I never left the room.

370
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,818
But you left the chair area.

371
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,450
That's it.
Give me your underwear.
