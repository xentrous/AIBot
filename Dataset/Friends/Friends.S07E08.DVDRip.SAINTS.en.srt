1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:06,202
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- No, no, no.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,101
What are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,367
We're playing a game
I learned.

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,011
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,748
What? That's like insanely easy.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,383
It's harder than it sounds.
You always forget one.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,621
Or, in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,122
It's stupid and I wasn't playing against
people, so technically, I didn't lose.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,292
You forgot 14 states?

10
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,758
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,499
Okay, time's up.

12
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,031
All right, I got 48.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,669
That's not bad. Pheebs?

14
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,807
I got tired of naming states, so I
decided to list the types of celery.

15
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,803
And I have one, regular celery.

16
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,748
So Rachel's got 48,
and Phoebe has the lead in...

17
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,580
...vegetables. Joey?

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,923
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,953
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

20
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,425
The One Where Chandler
Doesn't Like Dogs

21
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,493
Hey, how is New England not a state?

22
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,765
They have a sports team.

23
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,765
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

24
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,441
There you go.

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,277
How come we have
one extra place setting?

26
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,945
You invited your assistant.

27
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,708
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

28
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,682
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

29
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,854
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,184
I made him his own individual
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

31
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,353
I was going to,
but then I figured...

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,690
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

33
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,095
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

34
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:22,205
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, but I still do.

35
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,032
Regular celery!

36
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,006
I already have that.

37
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,479
Done...

38
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,682
...with time to spare.

39
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:37,389
- This may be a new world's record.
- I hate to lecture you guys...

40
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,093
...but it's disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

41
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,796
...and Joey, can't name all the states.

42
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:51,196
You ever see a map, or one of those
round, colorful things called a "globe"?

43
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,301
Magellan? You got 46 states.

44
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,000
- What? That's impossible.
- Forty-six.

45
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,542
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. L-Forgot-Ten-States?

46
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,382
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

47
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,484
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

48
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,280
I am only one man.

49
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,893
- Okay, time is up.
- Now, just give me another minute.

50
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,121
If you don't know them by now,
you will never know them, okay?

51
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,199
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,604
This is crazy. I can do this.

53
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,136
All right, I bet I can get
all 50 before dinner.

54
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,501
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

55
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,073
You're on.

56
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,782
Don't look at my list, because there's
a lot on there that you don't have.

57
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,384
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

58
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,317
The drawer full of takeout
menus is okay, right?

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,719
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

60
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,222
Chandler, give me a hand.

61
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:55,490
Joey, do not let Ross look at maps
or the globe in your apartment.

62
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,533
Don't worry.
It's not a globe of the United States.

63
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

64
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,806
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

65
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,518
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

66
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,018
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

67
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,620
Yes, I knit this.

68
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,656
I'm very good.

69
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,171
Ross' apartment is nice.
How come we don't hang out here?

70
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,136
Maybe because it smells a weird.

71
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,503
It's like old pumpkins or something.

72
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,880
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

73
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,280
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

74
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,316
We left Joey alone with the food.

75
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,685
Yep, yep, I knew it.

76
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,446
There he is...

77
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,660
...feeding stuffing to a dog!

78
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,862
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

79
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,570
Why is a dog in our apartment?

80
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,465
I'm sorry, who's this?

81
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,573
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,745
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!

83
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,080
- There's no dog here.
- Yes, there is!

84
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,352
He's black and white and shaggy.

85
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,850
He's sitting next to Rachel
and licking her hand.

86
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,421
Oh, my God! Where are you?

87
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,056
I'll be right there.

88
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,597
They're here already?
How are they doing this?!

89
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,530
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,866
I wanted to see if your offer
was still good.

91
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,941
Well, sure. Come in.

92
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,747
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,040
We kind of broke up this morning.

94
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,549
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

95
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,255
Ohio, thank you.

96
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,192
Where's the dog?

97
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,454
What dog? There's no dog here.

98
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,699
Yeah, that dog left.

99
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,669
Wait a minute. I thought we
agreed to say... Your thing. Yeah.

100
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,373
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

101
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,037
There's no dog in here.

102
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,878
Well, the hiding-the-dog plan
is off to a great start.

103
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,612
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

104
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,121
No, that's just me coughing.

105
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,564
Oh, good. There you are.

106
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,767
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

107
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,766
What is it doing here?

108
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,164
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

109
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,565
Wait.

110
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,570
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

111
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,779
May I please stay
with you nice people?

112
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,913
I wish he could stay here,
but Chandler's allergic.

113
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,848
Extremely allergic, okay?

114
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,113
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

115
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,859
...my throat will just close up.

116
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,427
That's odd. This dog's been
living here for the past three days.

117
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,597
Really?

118
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,504
If he's been here
that long...

119
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,902
...and you haven't had a reaction,
maybe you're not allergic to it.

120
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,668
It still has to go, right?

121
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,937
Why?

122
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,744
- Okay, it's...
- Don't do it!

123
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,550
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

124
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,949
Okay? It's time.

125
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,556
Okay, I hate dogs.

126
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,661
- What?!
- That's crazy? Why?

127
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,597
Told you.

128
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,601
They are needy...

129
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,570
...jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

130
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,209
...and that scares me a little bit.

131
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,340
You're right. They are scary.

132
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,746
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

133
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,214
So you're not allergic? I mean, does that
mean you're not allergic to wool either?

134
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,223
You bought me
a pink turtleneck sweater.

135
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,653
The guy in the catalog pulled it off.

136
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,395
Wait. Do you not like all dogs?

137
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,030
I mean, not even puppies?

138
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,735
Is there a puppy here?

139
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,000
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

140
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,972
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never
tell anyone about this dog thing.

141
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,046
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

142
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,720
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold!

143
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,689
It's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

144
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,291
Hurts my teeth.

145
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,329
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

146
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,067
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

147
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,598
So either the dog goes or I go.

148
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,740
Oh, my God!

149
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,509
How can I not get this?

150
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,118
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.

151
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,683
Twelve-fifty.

152
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,723
Damn, I forgot you were here.

153
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,528
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

154
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,921
We'll be back in a minute.

155
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,960
Before you go,
can I ask you a question?

156
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,862
When a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

157
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,970
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move?

158
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,764
I'd say about a month.

159
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,976
Really? I'd say three to four.

160
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,108
Half-hour.

161
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,580
Interesting.

162
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,081
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

163
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,720
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

164
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,721
Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

165
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,989
A "moo" point?

166
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,831
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

167
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,203
It just doesn't matter.

168
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,006
It's "moo."

169
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,582
Have I been living with him for too
long, or did that all just make sense?

170
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,779
Don't listen to Joey.

171
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,647
Okay, would you look at him?

172
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,484
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

173
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,524
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

174
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,164
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

175
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,199
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

176
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,869
No one ever listens to me.

177
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,405
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

178
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,618
Okay, I'm keeping my end of the deal.

179
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,225
Why is the dog still here?

180
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,294
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

181
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,863
- Come on.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

182
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,259
I could pull this off, right?

183
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,135
- Hey.
- Hey.

184
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,834
How you holding up?

185
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,645
Not bad.

186
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,974
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

187
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:29,277
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

188
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,819
I kind of thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

189
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,424
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

190
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,228
It's weird.

191
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,697
I used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

192
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,768
That all that was just a given.
Lately, it's like, what if it's not?

193
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,201
Do you ever have that feeling?

194
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,841
No.

195
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,435
Yeah.

196
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,643
All the time.
Constantly. It's terrifying.

197
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,975
But, you know, then I figure,
it has to work out.

198
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,909
Why?

199
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,621
Because it has to.

200
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,220
- You really have all the answers, don't you?
- No, no, I do. I really do.

201
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,898
- Thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

202
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,429
Hug it out.

203
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,992
All right, he likes you back.

204
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,867
Told you, you should go for it.

205
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,407
What?

206
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,710
Street noise drown any of that out?

207
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,375
No? See you later.

208
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,619
Okay.

209
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,491
What did Joey say? I like you back?

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,053
You know... Well, see... He...

211
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,762
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

212
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,128
And you were hugging me...

213
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,306
...so, obviously, you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah!

214
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,944
- Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
- No?

215
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,383
All right, here's the truth.

216
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,917
Joey said what he said...

217
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,316
...because I'm attracted to you.

218
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,727
Wow.

219
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,290
Yeah, I admit it.

220
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,531
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

221
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,359
...and nothing could ever happen.

222
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,935
The last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

223
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,004
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

224
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,542
Which is why it would be really great
if you said something right about now.

225
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,177
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

226
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,351
What?

227
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,882
Right there. That's my car!

228
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,315
- Hey!
- Okay, that's gonna take one minute.

229
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,991
Do you have anything else
you want to get off your chest?

230
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,352
I can't believe this.

231
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,256
We still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

232
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,329
Look, there they go.

233
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,563
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

234
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,335
Please, don't leave me.
I'll be lonely.

235
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,332
Stop it. Stop.

236
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,135
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

237
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,851
Did you hear that?
She said, "Monica."

238
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,355
I can't leave her.

239
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,524
We could sneak the dog back in,
and Chandler wouldn't even know.

240
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,624
That's not gonna work.

241
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,919
I had that dog for three days,
and Chandler had no idea.

242
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,493
He's not so smart.

243
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,200
Hey. I didn't know either.

244
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:33,564
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

245
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,437
Yeah, I knew.

246
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,311
Where's Chandler?

247
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,980
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

248
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,786
How did you know?

249
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,726
Hey, what's she doing back here?

250
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,724
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

251
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,635
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I laid out the states geographically.

252
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,997
We don't have time for this.
We have to keep him away from my room.

253
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,970
- Yeah, but, look what...
- This is what we do not have time for!

254
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,574
- Where's Monica?
- In Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

255
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,976
Why not?

256
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,283
Monica's crying.

257
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,419
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

258
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,893
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

259
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,191
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

260
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,198
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

261
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,564
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?!

262
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:50,075
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

263
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,977
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

264
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,950
So Monica and her friend Phyllis...

265
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,685
...take away the dog, and that was the
last time we ever saw him. See?

266
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,590
This is just like that...

267
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:09,561
...only with a few details changed.

268
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,930
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

269
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
Bring on the food.

270
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,605
- What's the matter?
- Monica's upset because of Klunkers.

271
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,943
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

272
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,721
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that.

273
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,048
What if it attacks me?

274
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,187
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

275
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,322
And that doesn't scare you?

276
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,795
Ross, you need some help?

277
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,603
From you?

278
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,432
Yes, please.

279
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,007
First of all, Utah?

280
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,849
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

281
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,791
Okay, Klunkers,
come here, you big gerbil.

282
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,030
Klunkers.

283
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,232
Where's my Klunkers, my little...?

284
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,530
No, no, no.
I am not going to do that voice.

285
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,333
Klunkers.

286
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,643
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

287
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,375
Come back here,
you furry, little butt-sniffer.

288
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,884
Not you, ma'am.

289
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,991
I hate America!

290
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,593
When I finish this game,
I swear, I am moving.

291
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,631
- Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

292
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,267
Damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

293
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,061
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you."

294
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,340
I know that I freaked him out.

295
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,405
If you said it like that, you did.

296
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,106
What was I thinking?

297
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,612
I work with this man.
I have to see him every day.

298
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,977
How'd this happen to me?

299
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,483
Oh, wait. That's right,
it was because of you.

300
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,523
All right, I think I can help you.
You wanna know what you have to do?

301
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,387
- Please, help me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

302
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,190
Now, you're gonna want to talk
to him about this, right?

303
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,698
But trust me, Rach,
that'll only make it worse.

304
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,167
You have to deny everything.

305
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,233
That conversation out there,
never happened.

306
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,674
Joey, I don't think that's gonna work.
It was a pretty long conversation.

307
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,211
There was no conversation.

308
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,918
Okay. Joey, I'm just gonna talk to Tag.

309
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,111
Who's "Tag"? There's no "Tag".

310
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,453
Okay. This conversation is over.

311
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,922
See? It works.

312
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,321
Hey, is Chandler here?

313
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,827
No, he went for a walk.

314
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,398
Okay, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

315
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,266
Well, no, no, no.

316
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,038
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

317
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,902
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

318
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,778
You think?

319
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,050
Hi, honey.

320
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,182
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

321
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,253
- What? Why would...?
- Wait and see.

322
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,652
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

323
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,059
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment
to bring back Klunkers for you...

324
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,802
...and I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

325
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,363
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

326
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,371
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

327
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,508
I couldn't find him...

328
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,478
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

329
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:51,086
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

330
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,653
We have good news. Look who's back!

331
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,394
Klunkers. Oh, my God!

332
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:05,103
- She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

333
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,237
It is so good to see you.

334
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,442
She came all the way back
from Ross' building.

335
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,303
The things she must've seen.

336
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,570
She climbed up the fire escape...

337
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:21,285
...and she tapped on the window with her
teeny, little paw, and we ran to let her in.

338
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,880
I went too far, didn't I?

339
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,689
When should I have stopped?

340
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:37,294
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

341
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,369
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states...

342
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,576
...and there are no more!

343
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,677
I think I should be able
to eat something.

344
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,782
It's up to you.

345
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,084
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

346
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,190
I gotta go down to the police station
and look at mug shots.

347
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,518
Thanks for having me over.

348
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,887
Tag, you're going?

349
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,861
We didn't even get a chance to talk.

350
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,430
So where did you say
you're from again?

351
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,968
- Colorado.
- What good are you?

352
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,707
Look, I think we should talk
about what happened on the terrace.

353
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,142
Okay.

354
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,178
I never should've said what I said.

355
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,613
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

356
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,253
We work together, so nothing could
really ever happen between us.

357
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:37,154
I would love to go to work on Monday
and never talk about this again.

358
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,159
Okay. Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.

359
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,728
So we okay?

360
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,993
I'm not.

361
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,397
I knew it.
I freaked you out.

362
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,366
No, you didn't.

363
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,642
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing could happen between us.

364
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

365
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,041
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

366
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,787
That's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

367
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,048
Delaware.

368
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,055
Delaware.

369
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,659
- All right.
- I want my turkey now.

370
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,662
You got it.

371
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,659
You got Nevada twice.

372
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:55,973
- I know.
- Yeah.
