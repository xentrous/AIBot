1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,400
-Guys, guess what?
-What?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,440
We're having a Halloween party!

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,720
-Good!
-Great!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,920
-You have to wear a costume.
-I can't make it.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,800
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,800
I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,400
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,360
Not two years in a row.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,600
-I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
-You have to.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,160
You're an actor.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,760
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,280
-I will.
-The girl from the wedding?

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,600
If she needs costume ideas,
she could be a bikini model..

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,200
or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,200
Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw
Massacre. No! Slutty Leatherface.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,440
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,400
That's right, he was hitting on her.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,160
And I got her. I guess
the better man won.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,360
Please don't take her from me.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,440
Ursula!

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,120
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,600
I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,960
Wait a second!

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,120
So, what's new with you?

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,920
Nothing.
I'm getting married next week.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
What?

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,880
It'll be a small ceremony.
Just family.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
His.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm happy for you.

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,080
Wait. If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,400
-Really?
-Sure.

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,160
You could be my sister for the day.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Yeah, okay.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,200
My friends are having a party tonight,
so you could come.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,560
Maybe I could meet the guy.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Well, I'm supposed to work tonight.

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,600
-It's a costume party.
-So that's why you're..

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
No.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
But thanks.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,000
-You're supposed to wear a costume.
-I am.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,560
I am a woman who spent money
on a dress she wants to wear..

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
because soon she won't
fit into it.

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
-Trick or treat!
-Can I give out candy?

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,360
I want to be with kids. Since I got
pregnant, I have maternal instincts.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,360
-Trick or treat!
-Just a minute!

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Look at you guys!

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,400
-Wow! You are a very scary witch.
-Thank you.

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,360
-And you are a very funny clown.
-Thank you.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,880
And you..

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
are so in style right now.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,840
I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line
has got this equestrian theme.

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,760
-Did you see the cover of Vogue..?
-Could I just have the candy?

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,960
Sure.

58
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Catwoman. So we meet again.

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
So we do, Supergirl.

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,800
It's me, Phoebe.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,560
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,040
I appreciate the costume.

63
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,400
You did this to him?

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
I thought he'd love it.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,360
-He loves The Velveteen Rabbit.
-That rabbit was brown and white.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,760
It was pink, or no bunny at all.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,760
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,760
-You didn't dress up either?
-Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

69
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,200
Dude, what happened?

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
How is that me?

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm Chandler.

72
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,000
That is so you!

73
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
-When have I ever done that?
-When have I ever done that?

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,960
Trick or treat.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,760
-You're the prettiest ballerina ever.
-Thank you.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,440
That deserves another candy.

77
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,560
Thank you.

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,160
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
I love you!

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,160
Honey, here, take it all.

81
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
Monica? We need more candy.

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,600
-There's only been four kids.
-I know.

83
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,400
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,440
No wonder you're pregnant.

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,240
-What are you supposed to be?
-Remember the satellite, Sputnik?

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,040
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"..

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,200
and these are my antenna.

88
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,360
So Sputnik becomes..?

89
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,960
Spud-nik!

90
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,760
Wow! I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

91
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,360
All right! Ross came as doodie.

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,520
-No, I'm not doodie.
-No, space-doodie.

93
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,040
Okay, I'm Spud-nik.

94
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,320
-You know, like Sputnik.
-What's a Sputnik, doodie-man?

95
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,920
Hey, sweetie.

96
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
-Aren't you gonna kiss me?
-Okay.

97
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,320
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

98
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,600
-Ursula?
-Ursula's fiance?

99
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,920
You're the sister. I just slapped
my future sister-in-law's ass.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,440
Is your mother here?
I could slap her on the butt.

101
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,480
-My mother killed herself.
-See, and I knew that.

102
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,320
Now I'm sweating.

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,280
No. We'll start over.

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,240
-Hi, I'm Phoebe.
-Eric.

106
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,920
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Sweat's burning my eyes.

107
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,480
-Thank you.
-There.

108
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,280
-What are you?
-There's no name for it.

109
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,240
-No, I meant your costume.
-I'm a solar system.

111
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,520
My second graders helped.

112
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,560
-I love the second grade.
-Really?

113
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,280
It's much better than first grade,
and definitely better than third.

114
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,880
With all the politics
and the mind games.

115
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,080
-So, what do you do?
-I'm a masseuse, by day.

116
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,520
-You don't have to stand with me.
-I'm having fun.

117
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,720
-I'm excited for you and Ursula.
-I feel very lucky. She's great.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,480
-She's the most beautiful woman ever.
-Thank you.

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
-Hey, Joey?
-Yeah?

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,720
-You read comic books, right?
-Exclusively.

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,280
Who would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

122
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,600
-Catwoman, hands down.
-Yeah.

123
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,080
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give Phoebe the edge.

124
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
-What? Really?
-You kidding?

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,520
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

126
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
She's not right behind me, is she?

127
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,120
No, you're fine.

128
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,120
-Could I take Rachel?
-I'm not sure.

129
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
What? Come on, I am tough!

130
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,600
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,080
Relax. Why are you so serious?
It doesn't matter.

132
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,960
Really? What if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I would say, "Woman, please."

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,360
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.

135
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,120
-You think you could take him?
-The dude with the balls on his chest?

136
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
I think so.

137
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,440
But what is he doing with my sister?
He's so great.

138
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

139
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,720
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

140
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,000
-Oh, my God, Phoebe?
-What?

141
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,080
-You're getting a crush on him.
-No, I'm not, you are!

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,120
Here comes the temper.

143
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
Trick or treat.

144
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went for more.

145
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,320
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
-Can I write you a check?
-Okay.

147
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,680
-Okay. What's your name?
-Lelani Mayolanofavich.

148
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,280
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

149
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,480
-Hi.
-Hi, Mona.

150
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,280
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was
hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.

151
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,480
Actually, I'm just a nurse.

152
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,680
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but I'm maxed out.

153
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,640
-You made it.
-Wait.

154
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,960
-You're a potato?
-Well, I'm a spud..?

155
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,320
-And the antenna.. You're Spud-nik!
-Yes!

156
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,280
Marry her.

157
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,800
Here's a good one. Who'd win
a fight between Ross and Chandler?

158
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,360
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

159
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
-So Ross?
-Yeah.

160
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,320
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hello, handsome.

161
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,760
Oh, God.

162
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
Look at you two.
When did you guys meet?

163
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,200
-Two weeks ago.
-That's it?

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,000
I know. It sounds crazy,
and I'm not impulsive, but..

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,120
-we have so much in common.
-Oh, really?

166
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,560
We're both teachers.

167
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,560
-And we were both in the Peace Corps.
-Peace Corps, really?

168
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,960
When we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and never met.

169
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

170
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
-Shall we get me really drunk?
-Sure.

171
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,560
Howdy, doodie.

172
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
That's funny, yeah.

173
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,440
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

174
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,880
Relax, man. You're looking
a little flushed.

175
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,160
-Our question might get answered.
-What question?

176
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,720
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,
you or Ross?

177
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,760
-There's no question.
-So you think Ross too?

178
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,800
-You picked Ross?
-Ross is strong.

179
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,560
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

180
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,600
-I can't believe you didn't pick me.
-She's right. I am stronger.

181
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
I would destroy you.

182
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,760
Really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

183
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,240
I'll prove it like a theorem!

184
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,520
All right! Stop it!

185
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,760
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

186
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,400
People came to see a fight,
let's give them one!

187
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,520
-You guys could arm-wrestle.
-Listen to the slutty nurse.

188
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,480
-You're going down.
-Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!

189
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,560
Seriously, guys, the trash talk
is embarrassing.

190
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much.

191
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,640
-You are so sweet.
-Really?

192
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,440
You are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

193
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,480
-Got to go.
-Trick or treat.

194
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,320
Hi! Wow! There you go.

195
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,080
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

196
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,120
We were, but now we've got candy.

197
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,280
I'd rather have the money.

198
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
That's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

199
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,640
This isn't fair.

200
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,080
Is it fair that you put on a cape
and get stuff?

201
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,240
Shut up!

202
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,840
You shut up!

203
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,680
-You can't tell me to shut up.
-I think I just did.

204
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,200
And here it comes again. Shut up!

205
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,480
No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

206
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,320
Wait, I had one more thing to say.
Right. Shut up.

207
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,000
You're a mean old woman.

208
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,000
Wait! Shut.. Don't cry!

209
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,160
Let me get my checkbook!

210
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,280
You don't have to do this. The
strength inside you means the most.

211
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,640
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

212
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,520
That's the strength I want in a man.

213
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,840
That means nothing to me. Come on!

214
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,440
-Hi, liar.
-Hey.

215
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,840
He's marrying you because he thinks
the things you were saying were true.

216
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,480
-They could be true.
-But they're not.

217
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
It's a fine line.

218
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,520
-Why are you lying?
-I don't know.

219
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,880
He did this stuff, I said I did it too.
He got so excited, it was fun.

220
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,040
You can't do this.
You're gonna ruin his life.

221
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,800
Why are you taking this so seriously?
It's just a marriage.

222
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,200
Besides, if I cheat on him,
I can call it an affair.

223
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,400
Honey?

224
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,280
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

225
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,920
She's helped so many people quit.

226
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,400
We'd better get going.

227
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,360
-You have a church group meeting.
-Right.

228
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,000
-It was nice meeting you.
-You too.

229
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,000
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

230
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,200
Come on! Bunny versus doodie.
We're waiting!

231
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,240
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

232
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,600
Wait. What does the winner get?

233
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
-Pride.
-And dignity.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,440
Okay, if you say so.

235
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
All right, ready, set, go!

236
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,240
-Come on!
-Come on!

237
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,400
-Wow, they're both really strong.
-Or equally weak.

238
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

239
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,680
-So you getting tired?
-No. I could do this all day.

240
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah. Me too.

241
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,080
-Getting a little tired, though.
-God, I'm exhausted.

242
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,240
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

243
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,320
She's talking to Joey!
You gotta let me win!

244
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,200
Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

245
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,800
At least you have a wife.
I get divorces and knock people up.

246
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,040
And I'm dressed as doodie.

247
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,400
-You're Spud-nik.
-Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

248
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,400
Please? She's watching.

249
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,400
-Fine.
-Thanks.

250
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,800
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah!

251
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,560
My hero!

252
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,040
You're a weird lady.

253
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,960
Ursula said she left her purse.

254
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,680
What a relief. It has the numbers
for her prayer chain.

255
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm sure it does.

256
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,000
Guess I'll see you at the wedding.

257
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,880
I don't think I'm gonna make it
to the wedding.

258
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,440
I wish you all the luck in the world.

259
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
And I also want to give you
a little piece of advice..

260
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
that I give to everyone
who's getting married.

261
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,520
Don't trust your wife.

262
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,560
I think we'll be okay.

263
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,960
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,560
-I can't let you do this. She's lying.
-What?

265
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,760
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

266
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

267
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,520
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

268
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,480
Here's the name tag from
where she works as a waitress.

269
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,880
Not a teacher, a waitress.

270
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
Here, she always lies about this.

271
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,320
-How old did she say she was?
-She told me she was 25.

272
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,080
I almost don't want to show you.

273
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,160
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

274
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,960
I am so stupid.

275
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
Of course she's not a teacher.

276
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,800
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

277
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,000
No, you're not stupid.

278
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm not smart.

279
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,520
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

280
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
-To be romantic.
-Good.

281
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,480
You should be impulsive and romantic.
You did it with the wrong person.

282
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
-What?
-It's weird, two people look so alike.

283
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,440
And so different.

284
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Eric! Let's go!

285
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,320
-Better go deal with it.
-Yeah, you should.

286
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,520
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

287
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,800
I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

288
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
That's not bad.

289
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,120
I also had to go to a few houses
as his girlfriend.

290
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
I am awful with children.

291
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,800
You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

292
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,320
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

293
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,000
-That's all it is?
-Absolutely.

294
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,600
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

295
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,800
They get crazy during the summer too.

296
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,320
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

297
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that.

298
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,960
Look, I'm sorry you lost.

299
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

300
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,000
Was that a secret, or a lie?

301
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,200
-No, I let him.. Ross?
-Yeah?

302
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

303
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,160
Chandler "let me win."

304
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,400
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

305
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,600
I am strong. I'll show you.

306
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,200
Chandler, please.

307
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
What's the matter? Scared?

308
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,960
Let's go, big bunny!

309
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,760
One, two, three. Go!

310
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,720
I'm gonna kill myself!
