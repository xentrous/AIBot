1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,040
Hey, I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. Do you wanna come?

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,960
Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,120
Oh, no, I'll be there too.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,320
So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,480
No, I just need you there for support.
I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,920
Oh. Why not?

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,160
Because I know he's gonna flip out,
and I hate it when he's angry.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,000
Rachel, this is all
so "Papa Don't Preach."

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,520
No, Phoeb, wait. He's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,240
He said if he ever saw me doing that
again, he'd make me eat the entire pack.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,840
Wow. Well, I will be there.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,040
Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man
make you eat your baby!

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,840
Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,800
No, you don't.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,920
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party!

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,240
Her what?

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,280
-You had a bachelorette party?
-She untied his G-string with her teeth.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,400
Somebody stop me!

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,000
We weren't having bachelor, bachelorette
parties. We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
It's a grand tradition!

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,480
Well, you could've untied it
with your hands.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,040
This is so unfair. The one thing I wanted was
to throw my best friend a bachelor party..

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
but I wasn't allowed.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
You went home with the waitress.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Yeah, that was a pretty good night.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,000
You know that the two pillars of
marriage are openness and honesty.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,000
I knew giving you that book was gonna
come back and bite me in the ass.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,320
-I'll order everyone the Moroccan chicken.
-Oh, I don't eat meat.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,040
It's chicken!

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,080
-I don't eat that either.
-I never understand you lesbians.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,840
-So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
-Well, actually..

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,960
Your '74 Lafite, sir.

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,400
I ordered the '75. That's a
magnificent wine. The '74 is sewage!

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,560
Why would you bring me sewage?

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,600
Is that a hard question? Are you an
idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,320
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you.

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,480
In case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,160
He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,320
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Rachel..

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,400
-Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
-Hey, that is the baby's problem.

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,080
-Everything okay with the waiter?
-I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,680
So, sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what is new with you.

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
I got TiVo.

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,560
-What's TiVo?
-It's slang for "pregnant."

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
Well, what were you thinking
asking me to come?

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,040
Are you really pregnant?

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,320
Well, yes and no.

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,600
Except, not no.

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,000
So to sum it up, yeah.

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,240
Who is the father?
Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
No, it's Ross. It's
Ross. You like Ross.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Daddy, I hope you're okay
with all of this.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
Think about it. This is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild!

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
You're gonna be a poppy!

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,120
That's true. I'm a poppy!

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I'm gonna be a poppy!

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,160
-So when is the wedding?
-The who?

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,520
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,080
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,920
-Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!
-February 2nd!

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,040
It was cool seeing you lecture today.

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,680
Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like
you were falling asleep.

69
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,120
No, I had my eyes closed so I could
concentrate and, you know, take it all in.

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.

71
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,280
-I've got to get going.
-Okay, I'll see you tonight?

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Thanks for showing me your
semiprecious-stone collection. It's amazing.

73
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,160
My God, you must be good in bed.

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,520
So you and Mona, it's been a while now.
How's it going?

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
It's good. It's going good.

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,200
I mean, we get along great.
She's so..

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,520
-Hot?
-I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!

78
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,440
She's okay with the baby?

79
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,680
I haven't actually told her yet.
I don't wanna scare her off.

80
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,040
You have to be honest. Otherwise, you may
think you're going down the same path..

81
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,320
but you're really going
down different ones.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm gonna take that book and I'm
gonna beat you to death with it.

83
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, my God, you are gonna
love me so much.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,240
Oh, good. Because so far in this
marriage, I just like you a lot.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,200
All right. I felt bad about
the bachelorette party thing..

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,160
so tonight you're gonna have
a bachelor party.

87
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,080
I got this number from this guy at work and
I hired a stripper to come dance for you.

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,880
Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?

89
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,360
-Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.
-Will you let the lady talk?

90
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,600
Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel so much better.

91
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,120
I got you party hats and porn.

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
Throw in my father making out
with the magician..

93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,840
and it's just like my 14th birthday
all over again.

94
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,120
Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.
I'm not a bachelor anymore.

95
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,680
Don't think of it as a bachelor party. Think
of it as a two-month anniversary present.

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.

97
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,120
Please, I feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked!

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,080
-Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.
-Yeah!

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,240
And Joey.

100
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,680
-Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
-Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

101
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
Actually, sorry, I can't even make it.
I'm seeing Mona tonight.

102
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,920
Who would cancel an actual date
just to go to a fake bachelor party?

103
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm sorry.
I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

104
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm sorry I won't make it to your
imaginary wedding, but I'm busy that day.

105
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,200
I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

106
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,480
I know, I know. I panicked.

107
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,360
I didn't want him to start yelling at me
like I was some '74 Latour.

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,280
It's Lafite.

109
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,960
The '74 Latour is actually
drinking quite nicely.

110
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,040
All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna be strong.

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,360
I just called a friend of mine.

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,080
I think I may be able
to book The Plaza on short notice.

113
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Really?

114
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
The Plaza?

115
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
Oh, Daddy!

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,720
-Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you.
-What is it, sweetie?

117
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,120
There's not gonna be a wedding.
Ross and I aren't getting married.

118
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,640
-I'm sorry, Daddy.
-I don't believe this!

119
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,480
-Daddy, stay calm, please.
-How do you expect me to stay calm?

120
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,240
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
And I wanna know why!

121
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,280
Is it because that punk
won't marry you?

122
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,160
-Is that it?
-Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

123
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
You nervous about getting married?

124
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,280
What are you doing?

125
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,840
Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party,
before your wedding. It'll be more fun.

126
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,160
All right. I can't believe
tomorrow's the big day.

127
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,920
How's it feel knowing you're never
gonna be with another woman?

128
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,360
Knowing you're gonna have to wake up
to the same face every day..

129
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,320
until you finally have
the sweet release of death.

130
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,720
You're right. This is more fun.

131
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
That's her! Okay, come on!

132
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,280
Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?

133
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,280
That's me!

134
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
That's me.

135
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,960
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

136
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,000
-Is that a bedroom?
-Yeah, right over there.

137
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,080
All right. Whenever you're ready.

138
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,640
That was weird.

139
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,440
-Why would she go in the bedroom?
-I'm waiting.

140
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
-So she's a..
-Yeah, that's one naked hooker.

141
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,120
I love your place.
Where is this guy from?

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
That's an 18th-century Indian artifact
from Calcutta.

143
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,040
Oh. Wow.

144
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,520
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

145
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,920
So much more.

146
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

147
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,680
Forget it. It's from Pier 1.

148
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,280
Sorry.

149
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,400
You think you can knock up my daughter
and then not marry her?

150
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm gonna kill you!

151
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,760
You know, this is actually not
a great time for me.

152
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,000
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.

153
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,080
-First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
-You got Rachel pregnant?

154
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
-Who did?
-You did!

155
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes, I did, but it was a one-night thing.
It meant nothing.

156
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter
means to you, nothing?

157
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,040
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
I care.. I love Rachel.

158
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,720
-What?
-But not that way.

159
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
I'm not in love with her.
I love her like a friend.

160
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,360
That's how you treat a friend,
get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?

161
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,760
Hey, I offered to marry her.
But I didn't want to.

162
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,160
Well, why not? So you could
spend your time with this tramp?

163
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,600
Tramp?

164
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.

165
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,280
I can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there!

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,080
Maybe she's a hooker
and a stripper..

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
but she got confused
about what to do.

168
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,160
Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
We just missed it.

169
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Ma'am?

170
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,600
Are you also a stripper?

171
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
No, but I can pretend to strip.
But that's gonna cost extra.

172
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,960
Okay, here's the extras:
handcuffs, spanking..

173
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,040
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

174
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,800
Getting her own husband a hooker.
That's pretty funny.

175
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.

177
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,360
-Do you mind if I smoke in here?
-Actually, I'd rather..

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,560
Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to
burn that room down anyway.

179
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,040
-How could you have kept all this from me?
-I was going to tell you, but..

180
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,800
You figure you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.

181
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

182
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,000
Can I..?

183
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Why don't we just let the machine get that.

184
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
Hey, Ross, it's Joey.
There's a hooker over here..

185
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,200
and we thought maybe you'd
know something about it.

186
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,200
No! No! No!

187
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,560
No!

188
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,960
I need to lie down.

189
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,800
Hey, guys, can I talk to you
for a minute?

190
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Listen, again, I want to urge you
to push the duck special..

191
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,320
because if they don't eat the duck,
you're going to, and it's not very good.

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,000
Tonight's the night
of the big bachelor party?

193
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,880
-Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
-No problem. Say, who's the party for?

194
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,320
-For my husband.
-You hired your husband a hooker?

195
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
-She's a stripper.
-No, she's a hooker.

196
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,440
-Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
-When they're hookers.

197
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,720
Oh, my God.
Stu, I can't believe you did this.

198
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,800
Now, you're sure she's a hooker?

199
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,680
It's either that, or she's just the best,
most expensive date I ever had.

200
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.

201
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
Why would she do that?

202
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,840
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.

203
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,720
Is there anything you're really bad at,
you know, sexually?

204
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,840
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.

205
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
-What's taking you boys so long?
-In a minute!

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,600
"In a minute"?
What's gonna happen in a minute?

207
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
All right. Maybe you should ask her
to leave.

208
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,520
-Why me?
-Hey, it's your bachelor party.

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,280
-Which is why you should do it.
-I don't want to. You do it.

210
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
All right. Rock, paper, scissors
for who has to tell the whore to leave.

211
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,560
-What?
-I miss this.

212
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't think we've
actually done this before.

213
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,640
No, I miss hanging out with you.

214
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,840
-We still hang out.
-Not like we used to.

215
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,000
Remember? You and me,
we used to be inseparable.

216
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,720
You know, now it's like
things are different.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,960
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.

218
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,320
And, hey, don't get me wrong,
I am so happy for you guys.

219
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,520
I just miss hanging out.
Just us, you know?

220
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah, I miss that too.

221
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,760
I'll tell you what. From now on,
we'll make time to hang out.

222
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,720
You got it. Come here.

223
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh, God.

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,080
Listen, I am this close
to robbing you guys.

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,640
She's a hooker! She's a hooker!
She's a..

226
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,160
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

227
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
So your dad dropped by.

228
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,640
He's a pleasant man.

229
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,080
-Oh, no.
-I better go.

230
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,720
Just over here.
I don't wanna miss the fight.

231
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
Ross, I am so sorry.

232
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,760
I promise, I will straighten this out
with him tomorrow, in person.

233
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,520
Or via e-mail.

234
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,160
I don't care about your dad. I care about
Mona. She was there and she's freaked out!

235
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
Okay, I'll fix that too.
What's her e-mail address?

236
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,640
All right, I promise, I'll fix this.
I swear. I'll talk to her.

237
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,520
Okay. Thank you.

238
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,760
That's it?
You call that a fight?

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,600
"We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!"
What happened to you two?

240
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,520
Thank you so much
for coming back over.

241
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,360
Oh, good. You're here.

242
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,080
And I was worried that
it was going to be uncomfortable.

243
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,280
No, Mona, just hear me out.

244
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,280
First of all, I am so sorry
about my father yelling at you.

245
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,920
But I heard that you held your own.
You have to tell me how you did that.

246
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,320
-Focus.
-Okay.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,520
Yes, Ross and I used to date.

248
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,920
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

249
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,960
But we are definitely not
getting back together.

250
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,600
-How can I be sure of that?
-Because we drove each other crazy.

251
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,600
He was possessive, he was jealous.
He could never just let the little things go.

252
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Trying to date this woman.

253
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,400
None of that compared
to how kind and gentle..

254
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,720
and thoughtful he is.

255
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
You probably shouldn't touch me.

256
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,600
I don't wanna get in the middle
of something so complicated.

257
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,040
I get it, but, Mona, what relationship
is not complicated?

258
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,000
We all have our baggage.
You must too.

259
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Why else would you still be single?

260
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm so gonna leave right now.

261
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,760
Should I leave this open?

262
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you
just tell me about all this?

263
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,440
Because what's going on has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

264
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,040
-You still should have told me.
-I know, and I was going to..

265
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,080
but I thought it was better
that you heard it from Rachel's father.

266
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
I made a mistake..

267
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,960
but it's only because
I really, really like you. Really.

268
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,440
Okay. I guess you can
close the door now.

269
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,360
Forgot my purse.
Oh, you guys made up.

270
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,000
He's a good kisser, isn't he?
I'm going!

271
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,840
I swear I didn't know
she was a hooker.

272
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,440
Did you let her smoke in here?

273
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,400
Her ass-print is still on your grandmother's
quilt. Really want to talk about smoking?

274
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,040
You know what,
I'm gonna make this up to you.

275
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,880
I promised you a stripper..

276
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,160
and you're gonna get a stripper.

277
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,400
-Monica, wait.
-What?

278
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,200
Carry on.

279
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,160
These tennis shoes are so tight.

280
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,040
-I think I'll take them off.
-Could you not narrate?

281
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Gotcha, sailor.

282
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,160
Just because
you're not in love with the guy..

283
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,120
-You told your dad the truth.
-About an hour ago.

284
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,640
-Wanna go see a movie?
-Yes.

285
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,080
Bye, Dad.

286
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,080
It's unacceptable! What the hell does love
have to do with it?

287
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,040
There are more important things
than love.

288
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
You have to think about the baby.

289
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,400
You have to think about
the consequences of your decisions!

290
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,880
Hey, I do think about
the consequences of my decisions!

291
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
Well, what gives you the right to..?

292
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,480
Go to hell!

293
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,400
Stupid guy on my phone.
