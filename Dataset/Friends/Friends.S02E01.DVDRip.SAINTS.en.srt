1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,134
Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,399
Every time he tried to tell her,
something got in the way...

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,474
...like cats, Italian guys.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,874
And finally, Chandler was,
like, "Forget about her."

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,677
When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,751
She was, like, "Oh, my God!"

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,787
So she went to the airport to meet him.

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,620
She didn't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.

9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,599
That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,061
But enough about us.
How have you been?

11
00:00:53,586 --> 00:11:34,473
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

12
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,240
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

13
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,712
Oh, my God!

14
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,719
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:34,990
Excuse me.

16
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,788
Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

17
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,463
Excuse me, excuse me.

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,773
There you are!

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,176
So, so...

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,144
How was China? You!

21
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,886
It was great.

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,053
What happened?

23
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,755
- You're bleeding.
- I am?

24
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,854
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,560
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

26
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,525
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,625
Well, where do I start?

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,771
This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

29
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:25,841
These are...

30
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,137
These are...

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,506
...aren't for you.

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,683
These are for you.

33
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,814
Welcome to our country.

34
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,188
Thank you. I'm from New York.

35
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,223
No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

36
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,364
Baggage claim?

37
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,973
I'm telling U. She went to the airport,
and she's gonna go for it with Ross.

38
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,773
Oh, my God! This is huge!

39
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,645
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

40
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,148
All right, what's bigger than huge?

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:12,989
This?

42
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,128
Guys, you got new haircuts!

43
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,422
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

44
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,196
Because, you know, "If you don't
look good, we don't look good."

45
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,165
I love that voice!

46
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,508
And the winner is Eva Godna!

47
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,975
Airport. Airport. Ross.

48
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,575
Not alone.

49
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,816
Julie.

50
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,216
Arm around her!

51
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,153
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

52
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,951
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

53
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,163
Quick, get the verbs.

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,559
You! You!

55
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,834
You said he liked me!

56
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,034
You!

57
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,636
You slowpokes!

58
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,466
That's all right.
We got the bags.

59
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,808
This is my sister, Monica.

60
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,811
This is Chandler.

61
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,038
Phoebe, hi.

62
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,318
Joey.

63
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,811
Everyone, this is Julie.

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,919
Julie.

65
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,160
But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

66
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,334
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

67
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,729
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

68
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,030
- With the screaming guy
- And the spitting.

69
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,841
You gotta hear this story.

70
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,441
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

71
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,939
Two hundred, at least.

72
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,010
And the chicken poops in her lap!

73
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,951
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,249
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

75
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,790
I just heard this story in the cab...

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,724
...and it is all I can think about.

77
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,601
This is amazing.

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
How did this happen?

79
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,098
We were in grad school together.

80
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,605
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

81
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,675
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

82
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,004
Julie!

83
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,047
Isn't that great?

84
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,212
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

85
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,290
It's an expression.

86
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,489
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

87
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,357
- Then we'll see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,566
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

89
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,134
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

90
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,271
Bye!

91
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,851
- Can I get some coffee?
- Sure.

92
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,354
- Did you talk to him yet?
- No.

93
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,958
Then, no.

94
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,403
What the hell happened to you in China?

95
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,640
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

96
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,606
I know I was.

97
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,783
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

98
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,215
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

99
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,014
God?

100
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,893
It was you, pal.

101
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,659
Maybe it was God doing me.

102
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,466
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

103
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,569
And then I met Julie...

104
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,441
...and we're having a great time.

105
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,647
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

106
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,784
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

107
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,478
Your lemonade.

108
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,756
I didn't order it.

109
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,594
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

110
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,361
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

111
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,598
So what did you find out?

112
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,766
He said...

113
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,503
He said...

114
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,334
They're having a great time.

115
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,678
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,307
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

117
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,378
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

118
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,989
...without any outside help whatsoever.

119
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,423
How is that a silver lining?

120
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,356
You have to really wanna see it.

121
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,027
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

122
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,031
Hey, Pheebs.

123
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,932
You know what I'm thinking?

124
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,080
How...

125
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,374
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

126
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,482
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

127
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,959
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

128
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,796
So what were you thinking?

129
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,531
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

130
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,737
No.

131
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,471
Why not?

132
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,833
Because I'm just...

133
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,135
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

134
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,305
No, you're not.

135
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,342
I know I'm not, but you are.

136
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,087
I was trying to spare your feelings.

137
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,188
Hold on.

138
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,388
Ross, Julie for you.

139
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,656
Anybody know a good tailor?

140
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,325
You need clothes altered?

141
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,960
No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

142
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,060
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

143
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,199
He did my first suit when I was 15.

144
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,869
No, wait, 16.

145
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,835
No, excuse me, 15.

146
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,306
All right, when was 1990?

147
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,750
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

148
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,458
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

149
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,890
Okay, bye.

150
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,797
That is so sweet.

151
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,698
Okay. No, you hang up.

152
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,204
No, you

153
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,973
One, two, three.

154
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,345
You didn't hang up either.

155
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,585
She didn't hang up.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,554
No, you hang up.

157
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,159
You. You.

158
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,838
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

159
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,334
Rachel.

160
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,146
I'll just call her back.

161
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,315
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

162
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,209
No, you hang up.

163
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,648
How did this happen to me?

164
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,255
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

165
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,752
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

166
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,825
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

167
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,135
...this really great guy
that I can't have.

168
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,730
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

169
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,304
I know you did.

170
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,472
I'm just gonna deal with it.

171
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,545
I gotta get out of here!

172
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,016
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

173
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,497
You know, I think I was 16.

174
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,302
Please, just a little bit off the back.

175
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm still on "no."

176
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,110
Morning.

177
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,179
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

178
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,511
No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

179
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,618
What's going on?

180
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,051
I sort of did a stupid
thing last night.

181
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,022
What stupid thing did you do?

182
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,968
Why don't you just go get dressed...

183
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,563
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

184
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,367
How did this happen?

185
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,871
I kind of ran into him last night.

186
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,376
- Where?
- At his apartment.

187
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,082
Is this juice?

188
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,447
And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

189
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,882
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

190
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,217
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

191
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,759
People do stupid things
when they're upset.

192
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,090
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't

193
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,806
But this is about
your horrible mistake.

194
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,608
Sorry we're late.

195
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,174
We were...

196
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,348
Well, there was touching.

197
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,190
Hey, Ross!

198
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,190
What a...

199
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,695
What are you doing here?

200
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,862
I do Raquel!

201
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,933
So he's back?

202
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,708
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

203
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,374
No, not a problem.

204
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,841
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

205
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,445
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

206
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,981
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

207
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,082
...my pants need to be altered.

208
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,727
When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

209
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,688
He'll know what it means.

210
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,897
You sure he'll crack that code?

211
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,165
It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

212
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,309
All right.

213
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,646
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

214
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,852
...and all Monica about it.

215
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,354
I promise.

216
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,122
All right, let's see.

217
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,622
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

218
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,956
But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

219
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,244
- That's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

220
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,348
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

221
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,849
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

222
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,247
...doesn't trust a person.

223
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,921
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

224
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,753
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

225
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,489
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

226
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,295
This is how he wears it.

227
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,465
How who wears it?

228
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,867
Demi Moore.

229
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,905
Demi Moore is not a "he."

230
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,739
Well, he was a "he"
in Arthur and in 10.

231
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,275
That's Dudley Moore!

232
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,621
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

233
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,949
Oh, my God!

234
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,150
Oh, God!

235
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,354
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

236
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,324
Which one is Demi Moore?

237
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:38,067
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

238
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,601
She's got gorgeous hair.

239
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,463
I know!

240
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,057
How long do you want the cuffs?

241
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,830
At least as long as I have the pants.

242
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,003
I just got that.

243
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,503
Now we'll do your inseam.

244
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,286
How is she?

245
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,524
It's too soon to tell.

246
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,162
She's resting, which is a good sign.

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,364
How's the hair?

248
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

249
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,275
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

250
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,278
Can we see her?

251
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,913
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

252
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,586
Ross, you come on in.

253
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,934
Well, how you doing?

254
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:17,931
I'm okay.

255
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,135
That bad, huh?

256
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,242
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

257
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,977
It's one of my gifts.

258
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,945
Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

259
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,087
...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

260
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,957
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

261
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,195
...50 feet of crap...

262
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,761
...then me.

263
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,724
Tell Ross how you feel.

264
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,027
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

265
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,205
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

266
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,533
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

267
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,878
I don't know. I don't know.

268
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,511
I've been with my share of women.

269
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,085
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

270
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,715
But the point is...

271
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,891
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

272
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,491
Really?

273
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,865
Yo, paisan!

274
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,576
Can I talk to you for a sec?

275
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,547
Your tailor...

276
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,079
...is a very bad man!

277
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,744
What are you talking about?

278
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,853
Hey, what's going on?

279
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,092
Joey's tailor...

280
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,525
...took advantage of me.

281
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,198
No way! I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

282
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,442
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

283
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,407
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite

284
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,579
What?

285
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,107
Cupping.

286
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,714
That's how they do pants!

287
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,782
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

288
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:26,087
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

289
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,960
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

290
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,228
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

291
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,346
What's the matter with you?

292
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,604
What?

293
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,017
That's not?

294
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,725
Oh, my God!

295
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,502
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

296
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:22,949
I like it.

297
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,455
I do. I think it's a 10!

298
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,986
Thank you.

299
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,729
My hair is very amused.

300
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,558
Come on, things could be worse.

301
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,161
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

302
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,968
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

303
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,309
Thank you.

304
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,706
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

305
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,039
Bye, Rach!

306
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,805
Wait, are you leaving?

307
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,813
That's what I meant by "bye."

308
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,744
Can I talk to you for a sec?

309
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,685
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

310
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,919
That's okay.

311
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,106
What's going on?

312
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,242
Well, okay, first of all...

313
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,342
...Paolo and I are not back together.

314
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,653
That was a stupid thing I did.

315
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,720
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

316
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,124
...well, I wouldn't.

317
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,459
Second of all...

318
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,261
What?

319
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,098
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

320
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,839
...I tell you what I think...

321
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,474
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

322
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,973
...and I look like
a complete idiot?

323
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,340
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

324
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,917
I hate him. I mean, I actually
I physically hate him.

325
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,516
I always have.

326
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,625
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

327
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,493
Really?

328
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,994
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

329
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,201
...and who gets how funny...

330
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,927
...and sweet and amazing...

331
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,174
...and adorable and sexy you are.

332
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:27,003
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

333
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,940
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

334
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,813
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

335
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,177
Like the way I do with Julie.

336
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,361
Was there a "second of all"?

337
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,196
No, I think that was the whole "all."

338
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,534
I gotta go.

339
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,806
Thanks.

340
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,853
No, I swear to God, Dad!

341
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,316
That's not how they measure pants!

342
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,389
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

343
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,067
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Really?

344
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,066
- You wanna do it now?
- Great!

345
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,869
See you.

346
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,739
I just wanna make
really sure this time.

347
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,314
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

348
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,384
No.

349
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,285
That's Roddy McDowall.

350
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,286
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

351
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,264
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
