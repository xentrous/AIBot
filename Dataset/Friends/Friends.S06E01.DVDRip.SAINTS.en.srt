1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,731
Okay, this is it.

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,073
You sure you wanna do this?

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,542
Hello, Mrs. Ross.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,977
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,958
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

6
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,724
Come on, Phoebe, hurry!

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,830
Okay! Okay!

8
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,665
Oh, my God!
Is everybody getting married?

9
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,441
No running in the chapel.

10
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,576
Hey, don't you give me
any of your.. Hey!

11
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,607
Why are you here?

12
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,012
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

13
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:56,517
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
-Yes. Why else would we be here?

14
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,355
What happened?
Did we miss it?

15
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,959
We missed it.

16
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,326
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,265
I can't believe they got married.

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,529
I know! I didn't even know
they were dating.

19
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,172
I don't think they're as much dating
as they are...

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,707
...two bottles of vodka walking
around in human form.

21
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,139
This is insane.

22
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,314
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

23
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,315
What?

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,320
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

25
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,353
If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

26
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,753
Really?

27
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,419
Yeah.

28
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,160
Oh, my God!

29
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,324
Oh, well.

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,032
The One After Vegas

31
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,575
Why are we in bed together?

32
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,072
I don't know.

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,107
-Did we?
-I don't know.

34
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,851
Do you have any clothes on?

35
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,910
Yes.

36
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,180
-Really?
-No.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,518
But we didn't have..

38
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,759
...sex, did we?

39
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,192
I don't remember much
about last night.

40
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,737
It was such a blur.

41
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,276
I remember laughing.
I laughed a lot.

42
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,945
Then we didn't have sex.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,112
Well, so, what did we do last night?

44
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,650
I don't know, but I think
it was a lot of fun.

45
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,090
Luckily, not too much fun, right?

46
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,991
-I don't think so.
-Oh, thank God.

47
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,725
Oh, I mean,
we were really drunk.

48
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm glad we didn't
do anything stupid.

49
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,464
Tell me about it.

50
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,379
Morning, Phoebe.

51
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,446
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

52
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,251
Joey, I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,717
You want my breakfast?

54
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,421
Too depressed to eat.

55
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,992
I'll probably eat in, like,
five minutes.

56
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,931
I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

57
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,725
-What about my cab?
-I don't need that anymore.

58
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,464
You borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

59
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,800
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

60
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,509
How about if you come with me?

61
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,111
-It's a long trip.
-That would be great.

62
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,646
We could talk and play games.

63
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,784
This could be our chance
to, like, renew our friendship.

64
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,316
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

65
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,518
Sure?

66
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,692
All right. Although, I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

67
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,767
So has anybody talked
to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?

68
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,338
They left me a message.
They'll be here.

69
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,204
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

70
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,378
It's a buffet, man.

71
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,048
Here's where I win
all my money back!

72
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,951
I gotta talk to you.

73
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,181
Sure.

74
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,551
What's up?

75
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,326
Monica and I almost got married.

76
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,968
My God!

77
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,163
That's huge!

78
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,400
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

79
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,644
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

80
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,177
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her...

81
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,913
...but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel...

82
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:04,095
...was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

83
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,026
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

84
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,034
Tell her she's not marriage material.

85
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,364
What?

86
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,040
Girls say it to me all the time.

87
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,014
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,112
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

89
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,755
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

90
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,290
-Well, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

91
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,427
Good. I was just testing you.

92
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,761
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

93
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,093
We were just talking about bacon.

94
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,563
No, we were talking about tennis.

95
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,069
Tennis is more believable.

96
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,936
Thank you.

97
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,076
Coffee.

98
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,213
What?

99
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,418
Are we gonna talk about
what you guys did last night?

100
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,056
What do you mean "last night"?
Nothing happened last night.

101
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,397
Ross invited us all to watch.

102
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,278
What is the matter with you?

103
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,475
We weren't gonna miss
our friends getting married.

104
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,547
Who got married?

105
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,152
You did.

106
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,515
What?

107
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,954
-Hello. We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't. That's ridi..

108
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,700
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

109
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,360
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

110
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,632
They let you get married.

111
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,037
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

112
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,412
Now, I'm drunk right now.

113
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,017
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

114
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,850
What are you gonna do?

115
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,489
Well, I guess we find
a divorce lawyer.

116
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,819
Well, I think.. I think
Ross already has one.

117
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,829
Yeah, that guy's finally gonna
be able to put in that pool.

118
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,224
Okay.

119
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,429
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.

120
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,369
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

121
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,067
...because we don't need
to get divorced.

122
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,110
-We're just gonna get an annulment.
-An annulment?

123
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,546
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,955
Oh, that's your thing!

125
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,049
What?

126
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,187
Your thing. You're the guy
who gets divorced.

127
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,430
No, no, that's not "my thing."

128
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,260
I do not love getting divorced.

129
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,796
Yes, you do. This is
your third divorce.

130
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,703
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it...

131
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,408
...and then it won't work out,
so you're gonna have to divorce it.

132
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,480
I'm so drunk.

133
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,224
-You wanna play some Pai Gow?
-Maybe.

134
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,456
But I kind of think we should talk
about last night.

135
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,625
That's a good idea.
I wanna talk about last night too...

136
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,933
-and I don't know what Pai Gow is.
-I see.

137
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,066
-So what should we do?
-I don't know.

138
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,972
I know I love you.

139
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,770
I know I love you.

140
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,253
Where are we on the whole
"going back...

141
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,447
to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

142
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,920
That's a good question.

143
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,888
Last night we let the dice decide.

144
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,123
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

145
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,967
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

146
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,797
So say...

147
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,496
you roll another eight,
then there's a sign...

148
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,969
that we should marry.

149
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,768
Eight we get married...

150
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:16,312
but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12, we don't get married.

151
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,640
Sounds great.

152
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,744
Hey, we got a shooter.

153
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,112
Money, please.

154
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,514
-Ready?
-Ready.

155
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,518
Come on, eight.

156
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,623
Yes, yes, eight.

157
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,491
Eight, easy eight.

158
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,160
-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
-That was so unlikely.

159
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,933
Let's get married.

160
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,802
I guess.

161
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,045
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

162
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,113
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

163
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,017
I wanted it so bad!

164
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,514
Wanna go pack?

165
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,284
We're doing the right thing.

166
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,986
Of course we are.

167
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,028
We left it up to fate.

168
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,862
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

169
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,713
Okay, you have 19 questions left.
Use them wisely.

170
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,851
Come on, Joey. You can't win
if you don't ask any questions!

171
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,523
-What?
-You promised me a fun road trip.

172
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,494
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.

173
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,930
We are switching, and
you are going to drive back.

174
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,003
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper!

175
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,032
All right.

176
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,108
And until then, you are going
to sing to me...

177
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,747
...because the radio's broken and you
are selfish, but you have a nice voice.

178
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,875
-Really?
-Sing!

179
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:04,216
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

180
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,027
Man, this is a long drive.

181
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,133
Are my eyes open?

182
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,631
No!

183
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,177
Morning.

184
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,958
-Hey.
-Hey, hubby.

185
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:53,100
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that whole annulment thing.

186
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,330
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

187
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,818
Okay.

188
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,384
So we'll just stay married.

189
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,851
Yes, exactly.

190
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,891
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

191
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,056
Wow, this is so amazing.

192
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,201
I really thought I'd have to
talk you into this more.

193
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,071
Now I'm scared because I don't
actually think you're kidding.

194
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,338
I'm not kidding.

195
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,011
Look...

196
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,443
...I can't have three
failed marriages.

197
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,206
I can't, okay?

198
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,613
I am not gonna be that guy.

199
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,823
Okay? No, no. That is not gonna be
"my thing."

200
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,421
So, what, we just
stay married forever?

201
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,359
I don't know.

202
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,927
I mean, I haven't worked it all
out yet, but...

203
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,265
Okay, I know it's a bit crazy..

204
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,431
How is this going
to affect you, really?

205
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,375
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while...

206
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,746
instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs."

207
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,888
It's right next to it.

208
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,688
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

209
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,623
We can stay married...

210
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:28,424
because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

211
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,001
-No, they're right..
-Ross!

212
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,432
All right.
Just...

213
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,609
please take a moment here...

214
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,711
and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

215
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:46,007
I am asking you to do me a favor.

216
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,987
You are asking me to be your wife.

217
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:57,128
And as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

218
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,761
We did make vows.

219
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,939
That kid kicked me really hard.

220
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,141
Well, you did pull his hair.

221
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,677
-He took my snack.
-I'm not getting into this again.

222
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,473
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

223
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,741
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

224
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,418
There. There. Okay.

225
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,487
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.

226
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,493
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

227
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:43,334
He could be a rap.. He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

228
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,271
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

229
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,777
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

230
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,450
-And, you, are you a rapist?
-No.

231
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,346
Do you like car games?

232
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,814
Yeah, you know
the license plate game?

233
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,717
I love the license plate game!

234
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,857
I'll play. I'll play.

235
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,119
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night.

236
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,638
Listen. I know you wanted
to talk to me...

237
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,400
but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

238
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,972
We register...

239
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,910
and you get to keep
all the presents.

240
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,678
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

241
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,187
I've thought about
how to tell you this.

242
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,153
I came up with an analogy
about a little goldfish...

243
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,125
in a pond that freezes over
in the winter...

244
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,630
but I realized that was a story about
what to do when people pick on you.

245
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,133
So I'm gonna actually save that
for my children's book.

246
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,797
-What's up?
-Oh, sorry.

247
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,463
The bottom line, Ross...

248
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,405
is we cannot stay married.

249
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,747
-I don't know if that's true..
-Oh, but it is.

250
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,817
Okay. You know what this is?

251
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,511
This is a difference of opinion.

252
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,725
-When that happens in a marriage..
-Ross, come on!

253
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,556
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

254
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,027
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

255
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,874
All right.
All right, I'll do it.

256
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,440
Thank you.

257
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,072
Hey, hey...

258
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,412
is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

259
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,089
There's the train station.
This is where I get off.

260
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,588
I have your address
and phone number.

261
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,853
I have your name and the fact
that you're a drifter.

262
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,896
So ball's pretty much
in your court.

263
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,561
All right. See you, Phoebe.

264
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,735
Come on, Phoebe, I can't
take this anymore.

265
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,277
Please talk to me.

266
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,614
Let me make it up to you.

267
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,088
Ground control to Major Tom

268
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,323
Commencing countdown
Engines on

269
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,826
Take your protein pills

270
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,968
And put your helmet on

271
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,840
-This is..
-Stop it! Stop it! No!

272
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,244
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

273
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,572
Phoebe, look, I am so sorry.

274
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,513
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend...

275
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,449
and I didn't deliver, okay?

276
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:49,616
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

277
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,664
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

278
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,860
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

279
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,368
Thank you.

280
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,440
So can we play 20 Questions now?

281
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,477
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

282
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,307
Okay.

283
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,776
Is it...

284
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,386
a kind of hot sandwich?

285
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,455
Yes.

286
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,050
Is it a meatball sub?

287
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,226
That is incredible!

288
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,660
You are the master!

289
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,732
Bug!

290
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,171
-Enough already!
-Well, you didn't have to catch them!

291
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,479
-You look like you're..
-Don't say it!

292
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,378
Don't even think it.

293
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,880
All right.

294
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,714
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

295
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,788
Should we just get married?

296
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,726
All the signs are telling us to do it.

297
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,264
I'm sick of the signs.

298
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,163
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.

299
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,133
-I don't want change, do you?
-No.

300
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,502
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!

301
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,745
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it drives me insane!

302
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,449
Jeez, relax, it's not
like we're mar..

303
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,855
You know, I was thinking,
what if I...

304
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,930
unpack here?

305
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,822
All your stuff would be here.

306
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,263
Well...

307
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,870
...what if all my stuff was here?

308
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,440
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

309
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,706
Doesn't make any sense.

310
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,547
Okay.

311
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,281
What if we live together,
and you get what I'm saying?

312
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,183
Live together?

313
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,684
There've been no signs for that.

314
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,024
Me asking is kind of a sign.

315
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,528
Yes! Yes! Yes!

316
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,476
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

317
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,545
Here's your key. Here's your key.

318
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,376
Now go out and christen it!

319
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,017
Go out and come back in!

320
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,744
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

321
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,315
-Ready?
-Ready!

322
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,053
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

323
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,992
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

324
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,860
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very old key!

325
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,400
-It's an old key!
-Oh, my God, it's old!

326
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,499
I love you.

327
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,069
I love you.

328
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,770
Are you hugging the door right now?

329
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,513
No.

330
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,585
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

331
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,754
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

332
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,932
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

333
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,430
Ross, thank you.

334
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,703
Do you wanna go see a movie?

335
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,702
-Yeah, why not?
-Phoebe?

336
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,772
No, thanks.
I've already seen one.

337
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,108
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.

338
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,479
You wanna hear something weird?

339
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,050
Always.

340
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,816
I didn't get the annulment.

341
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,581
What?

342
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,385
We're still married.

343
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,655
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

344
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,069
What are you doing?

345
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,746
Key is stuck in the lock.

346
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,506
I can fix it. Hold on.

347
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,052
