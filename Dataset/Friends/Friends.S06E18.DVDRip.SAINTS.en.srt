1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,831
I got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:12,341
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:17,675
You are definitely the hottie
of the Paleontology Department."

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,351
"Hotties of Paleontology."
There's a big-selling calendar.

5
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,588
-Who wrote it?
-The evaluations are all anonymous.

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,854
-You have their exams?
-Yeah.

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:35,398
You could just match the handwriting
and there's your admirer.

8
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,965
A hot girl's at stake
and he's Rain Man.

9
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,734
Wait a minute. Why are we
so sure that this is a girl?

10
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,414
It's a girl!

11
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,979
But it wouldn't matter.

12
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,587
Because I'm a teacher.
She's a student.

13
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,157
-It's illegal?
-It's frowned upon.

14
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,624
-And there's a big age gap.
-When you're 90..

15
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,231
I know, she'll be 80 and it won't
seem like such a big difference.

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,227
That's not what I was gonna say.

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,776
When you're 90, you'll still have the
memory of being with a 20-year-old.

18
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,275
The One Where Ross Dates A Student

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,350
-Monica..?
-I don't know.

20
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:07,182
You know your college friend
who became a movie director?

21
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,919
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

22
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:16,627
-What's a movement class?
-He's pretending he didn't take mime.

23
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,104
She's directing a new Al Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition.

24
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,572
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

25
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,644
Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

26
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,042
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3000..

27
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,947
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing
the subject? What?

28
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,088
-Will you make the call?
-Okay, I'll try.

29
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:43,489
Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,460
Remember Thursday.
Remember Thursday?

31
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,226
Yeah, so Tuesday?

32
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,533
Thursday!

33
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:57,641
Just think of it like this:
The third day. Monday, one day.

34
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,844
Tuesday, two day.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,273
Wednesday...
When day, what day?

36
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,676
Thursday!

37
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,508
The third day, okay?

38
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,278
-Thank you.
-Okay.

39
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,922
-Hey, Monica..?
-She doesn't know.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,389
-I'm gonna check my messages.
-You thought of that in there?

41
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,432
Nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

42
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,135
Hello?

43
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,334
Rachel.

44
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,874
Someone's in our apartment.
Call the cops!

45
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,635
You're on the phone!

46
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,207
-Oh, my God!
-What?

47
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,884
Oh, my God! Thank you!

48
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,315
There was a fire at our place.

49
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,981
-Oh, my God! How bad was it?
-It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.

50
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,027
-Come on, we gotta go!
-Yeah, come on.

51
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,661
What are you smiling about?

52
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:59,469
The part I want to audition for is
a fireman. This is so meant to be!

53
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:11,346
You were very generous
with your grades this semester.

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,282
-Professor Geller?
-Yeah?

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,627
-I really enjoyed your class.
-Oh, thank you. Thanks very much.

56
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,260
I'm a little embarrassed about
calling you a hottie.

57
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,598
-That was you?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:37,708
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

59
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,942
Want to go out sometime?

60
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,912
That's not the best idea.

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,110
Oh, because I was thinking,
the semester's over.

62
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,950
-You're not my teacher anymore.
-What time?

63
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,588
Oh, you know what? Forget it.

64
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,263
I see you already gave me an A.

65
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,965
-Gotcha.
-I'm kidding! God!

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,268
So seriously, what time?

67
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,775
Coming through. Coming through.
Oh! Hello. Hi.

68
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,279
Right. Coming through!

69
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,578
Okay. It's not so bad.

70
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,083
Most of the damage
was contained to the bedrooms.

71
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,224
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

72
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,361
-Excuse me?
-Joey! He's working.

73
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,023
You would look good in that.

74
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,994
Oh, how bad is it?

75
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,668
It's really bad.

76
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:41,863
The only thing that isn't burned is an
ax, which I do not remember buying.

77
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,007
-How's your room?
-Everything's ruined.

78
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,645
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.

79
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,575
Isn't that mine?

80
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,376
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

81
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:58,314
You won't be able to live here for
a while. You have a place to stay?

82
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,855
Oh! Wow!

83
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,994
Okay, look, pal...

84
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,489
I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

85
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,999
But if you give me your number,
I'll call you sometime.

86
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,364
Yes, they can stay with us.

87
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,941
Do you know what
started the fire, Mr. Fireman?

88
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,703
Well, do either of you smoke?

89
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,246
No. But yeah,
I could use one now. Thanks.

90
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,180
-Do you light candles, burn incense?
-I do all the time. I love them!

91
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,720
Oh, my God, I did it! It's me,
it's me! I burned down the house!

92
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:39,227
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

93
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,762
I warned her about those candles.

94
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,034
I can't believe how long it's been.

95
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,176
Hey, Chandler, is that..?

96
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,049
-Oh, that's great, good for you.
-So, is it..?

97
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:03,212
Okay. So, yeah, maybe
we can get together...

98
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,061
Hold on for one second.

99
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,491
What?

100
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,962
Do you want to get a pizza later?

101
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,834
Hi, I'm back.

102
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,198
Yeah, that sounds great.
We'll do it then. Okay, bye.

103
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,214
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

104
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,514
Hi. We didn't get to it.

105
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,208
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,114
Now you're going on a date
with this girl?

107
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,348
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

108
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,822
You can't just call up
and ask somebody for a favor.

109
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,895
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

110
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,326
Right, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,034
-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
-We only went out once.

112
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,895
You dated her?!

113
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,667
Not once.

114
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:01,375
Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

115
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,880
You want to do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

116
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,693
That's great. My friend Joey's
in the movie business.

117
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,730
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

118
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,324
My friend's name is Joey.

119
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,267
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

120
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,599
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
if he can edit my new movie.

121
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,207
Can you believe that?

122
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,243
You know, I haven't spoken to him
in 10 years...

123
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,109
and he asks me for a favor?

124
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,917
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

125
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,088
No "How you doing?"

126
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,418
Man, I mean, not even
a cup of coffee first.

127
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,459
-The nerve.
-Yeah.

128
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,027
Refill?

129
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,132
This is last-minute, so I want
to apologize for the mess.

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,928
Oh, who cares?

131
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,774
Oh, my God! It sure didn't look
this way when I lived here.

132
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,377
I know!

133
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,616
But there's only room for one, so one
of you will have to stay at Joey's.

134
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,880
Since the fire was kind of my fault,
you should get to stay here.

135
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:23,117
Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
fault. It was an accident.

136
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,830
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

137
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,656
Okay!

138
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,893
You're the first guest
at "Hotel Monica."

139
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,161
Hotel Monica!

140
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,429
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

141
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,074
I thought I'd bring them
to you in bed.

142
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,642
-You've been through so much.
-I have.

143
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,316
This right here is where
I keep the pizza.

144
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,812
And that's where the napkin is.

145
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,019
-What's that smell?
-I know! I don't...

146
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,922
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

147
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,432
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson."

148
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,659
Who?

149
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,840
Oh. I had trouble remembering names,
so I came up with nicknames.

150
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,102
The guy on the other side of you
was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt."

151
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,444
Oh, yeah.

152
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,220
-So did you have a nickname for me?
-No. No.

153
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,479
Yes, you did. What was it?

154
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,858
"Cutie McPretty."

155
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,029
Oh, that's so sweet!

156
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,426
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

157
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,538
You said it might be weird,
the whole student/teacher thing?

158
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,538
And to be frank,
I thought it would be too.

159
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,073
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.

160
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,081
-Dr. Geller!
-Burt!

161
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,352
-Did you sleep well last night?
-I did.

162
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,049
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

163
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,527
Know what Joey left on my pillow?

164
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,890
Gum.

165
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:11,897
-We determined the cause of the fire.
-I know. It was my candle, my candle!

166
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,897
No, there was an appliance left on.
It looks like a curling iron.

167
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,576
-I don't use a curling iron.
-Someone does.

168
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,709
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

169
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,517
-It could've been a hair straightener.
-Oh.

170
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,882
This is where I keep the pizza.

171
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,226
And..
Hey, where'd the napkin go?

172
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,021
What is that?

173
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,700
Is that old shrimp?

174
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,070
I think it is!

175
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,602
I wouldn't want my best guest
to strain her eyes.

176
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,644
Thanks, Monica.

177
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,151
-Does that smell bother you?
-From Joey's?

178
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,253
I can hardly smell it over here.

179
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,456
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.

180
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,425
-I can smell it a little, bake a pie.
-Okay.

181
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,828
Hello?

182
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,902
One minute, please.
It's the fire inspector.

183
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,665
Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

184
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,265
Really?

185
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,346
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
the hair straightener...

186
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,311
that started the fire.

187
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,915
No, no. It was the candles.

188
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,487
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

189
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,353
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is...

190
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,860
okay, well I have to go now.

191
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,839
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

192
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,875
I thought the age difference might be
a problem, but it wasn't.

193
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,445
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

194
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,123
A concept lost on some people.

195
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,949
It's okay to date a student?

196
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,061
Well, not really. Technically,
it's not against the rules.

197
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,289
But it's frowned upon, especially by
the professor we saw last night:

198
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,501
"Judgy Von Holier-than-thou."

199
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:31,499
You don't want to get a reputation
as "Professor McNails-his-students."

200
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,838
-Yeah. What should I do?
-Well, it seems pretty clear.

201
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,313
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?

202
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,023
-You gotta follow your heart.
-Joey, that's so sweet.

203
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,729
-Hi.
-Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?

204
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,595
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open? Say, Thursday?

205
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,197
-I couldn't do it.
-You couldn't do it?

206
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,873
I need more time.
We're going to dinner.

207
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,938
You're going out with her again?

208
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,838
-Going out with who?
-Dana Keystone, from college.

209
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,744
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she...?

210
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,951
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

211
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,518
Oh.

212
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,784
-Joey, you didn't even know her!
-Yeah, whatever.

213
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,758
Great story again.

214
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,900
The yarns that you weave!

215
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,904
You know, actually, I should get going.

216
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:39,100
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.

217
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,081
Oh, I am really flattered.

218
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:49,721
But I just...
I don't feel that way about you.

219
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,381
Oh, no, no. That's not..

220
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,220
I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you're such a sweet guy...

221
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,589
and I don't want to hurt you.

222
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,925
I wish I could do something
to make you feel better.

223
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,261
No.. Really?

224
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,065
Of course.

225
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,267
Well, it just hurts so bad, I...

226
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,273
Oh, I'm sorry.

227
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,915
-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
-What? Anything. Anything.

228
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,950
Well, I mean, this is just
off the top of my head now.

229
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,914
But I have this friend..
This actor friend.

230
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,251
He would kill me if he knew
that I was doing this.

231
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,086
But...

232
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,694
would it be possible for him to
audition for your movie on Thursday?

233
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,303
Absolutely.

234
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,766
But...

235
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,943
you'd really feel better if your
friend could audition for my movie?

236
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,305
The heart wants what it wants. Bye.

237
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,022
Hey! How's it going?

238
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,317
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

239
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,659
Yes, it has. I made cookies!

240
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,831
I'm still full from your
homemade potato chips.

241
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,159
But you should eat them now,
because they're hot from the oven.

242
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,527
Okay.

243
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:18,233
But not in here! Can't eat them
in bed, remember? No crumbies!

244
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,674
Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.

245
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,904
Okay.

246
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,218
-What are you doing?
-This doesn't lock, does it?

247
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,827
-Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, don't worry about it.

248
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,504
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.

249
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,267
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

250
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,575
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

251
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,009
Yeah.

252
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,350
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know.

253
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,192
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

254
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,196
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?

255
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,427
I can't.

256
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,235
-Oh, you have some studying to do?
-No, I have some turning 21 to do.

257
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,948
You know, I remember when I was
in college, we used to..

258
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,755
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.

259
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,553
Do you not want to be seen with me?

260
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,230
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

261
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,561
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

262
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,397
What? No, no, wait, wait..

263
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,408
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

264
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,644
I mean, we like each other, right?

265
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,745
There's nothing wrong with that.

266
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,805
Come on.

267
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,921
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

268
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,525
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi.

269
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,193
Aren't you in my popular culture
class?

270
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,897
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.

271
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,828
And we're dating.

272
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,161
And you may frown upon that but...

273
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,804
we're not gonna hide it anymore.

274
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,541
You are so fired.

275
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,945
-What?
-They'll fire you.

276
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,705
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.

277
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,544
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

278
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,025
I love it at Joey's!

279
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,195
-Nice!
-Thanks.

280
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,729
So you busy Thursday?

281
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,899
Oh, very funny. Remember? My
audition was supposed to be Thursday.

282
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,511
You got me the audition?
Let's hug it up!

283
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,978
Okay, okay! What are you
gonna do to me if you get the part?

284
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,312
-Hey.
-Hi.

285
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,045
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.

286
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,587
I know they said the hair straightener
started the fire.

287
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,850
But I think I'm partly at fault.

288
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,586
You see, I didn't tell you, but...

289
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,526
I had recently refilled
the tissues.

290
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,429
And so, let's face it,
that's just kindling.

291
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,706
So I think it's fair that
I stay at Joey's.

292
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,671
No, no, no, this was my fault.

293
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,344
-Besides, I'm fine here.
-Okay.

294
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,510
-Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
-Really?

295
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:48,083
-She said something about crumbies.
-No, no, no! I was so careful.

296
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,086
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

297
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,251
That's right. All the ladies
want to stay at Joey's.

298
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,865
No, I don't want to switch.

299
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,761
Please! I can throw
wet paper towels here!

300
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,461
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

301
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,709
I know. I'm sorry.

302
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,935
All right, fine.

303
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:19,143
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.

304
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,216
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

305
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,727
I can't date you or have
a hot plate in my office.

306
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,125
I can't believe we have
to stop seeing each other.

307
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,967
For what it's worth, I did appreciate
you standing up for me.

308
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,070
That felt really nice.

309
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,837
Kind of made me like you even more.

310
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,279
I know, I know. I really like
you too. But we can't date.

311
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,918
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.

312
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,321
-Wow.
-What?

313
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:03,187
Just hearing you describe it
as "forbidden"...

314
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,020
it's really hot.

315
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,364
Really?

316
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,700
Yeah.

317
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:16,131
Well, I don't care how hot it is,
it's wrong.

318
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,505
-Stop it.
-No, no. It's wrong.

319
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,437
It's naughty.

320
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,876
It's...

321
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,184
taboo.

322
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,545
Shut the book.

323
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,489
Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.

324
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,187
Hey.

325
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,624
Hey.

326
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,564
-So?
-So...?

327
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,867
It's Thursday!
How was the audition?

328
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,305
It's.. Monday, one day. Tuesday,
two day. Wednesday, what day..

329
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,735
Oh!
