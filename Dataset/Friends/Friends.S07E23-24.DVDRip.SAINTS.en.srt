1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,997
Do you realize this is the
last time we'll be here...

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,696
...as six single people?

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,740
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,650
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,217
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

6
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,584
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

7
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,256
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

8
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:31,227
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with Mom.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,227
Joey, you too?

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,525
I just heard "lunch."

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,934
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,275
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

13
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,943
I need to talk to you
about something.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,110
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,946
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.

16
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,353
No, it's not that.

17
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,418
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

18
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,960
...but as Monica's older brother.

19
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,598
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

20
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,431
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,541
Do I still call you Ross?

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,570
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

23
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,346
But as her older brother,
I have to tell you this:

24
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,551
If you ever hurt my little sister...

25
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:37,186
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

26
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,531
...I will hunt you down...

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,365
...and kick your ass.

28
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,333
What? I'm serious.

29
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:58,012
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

30
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,843
...and thanks for the warning.

31
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,349
No problem.

32
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,422
Are we friends again?

33
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,952
Yeah.

34
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,323
You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

35
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,629
The One With Monica
and Chandler's Wedding

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,833
What you doing, Mon?

37
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,836
I'm listing things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

38
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,167
So I can be prepared.

39
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:01,677
- What are they?
- So far, the dresses won't get picked up...

40
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,112
...my veil gets lost
or I don't have something blue.

41
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,285
I'm responsible for all those.

42
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,550
I had to go with the odds.

43
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,659
Remember that audition I had a
while ago and I didn't get the part?

44
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,625
- The commercial?
- That play?

45
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,593
That other play?

46
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,528
- The movie?
- Yes!

47
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,998
The one about the dog
who flies planes?

48
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,071
No. But, man, that one hurt.

49
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,300
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,172
Back then we called it
"The Great War."

51
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,239
It really was.

52
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,281
The guy they wanted backed out!
I start shooting today!

53
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,512
Congratulations!

54
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,090
- Today's the rehearsal dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

55
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,989
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

56
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,664
See you. I'm off
to fight the Nazis.

57
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:57,199
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWll, not WWI.

58
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,367
Who was in WWI?

59
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,672
Go ahead.

60
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,670
You're gonna be late!
Go! Go!

61
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,249
Who did we fight in WWI?

62
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,048
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

63
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,069
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,231
Richard, we're ready for you.

65
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,344
Joey Tribbiani, this is Richard Crosby.
He's playing Vincent.

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,842
- I'm acting with you?
- Nice to meet you.

67
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,043
I can't believe this. This is incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

68
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,280
No, I didn't.

69
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,548
I think you did.

70
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,526
I think I lost, three times.

71
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,795
- Cookie? Would you...?
- No.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,868
We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

73
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,167
- Can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

74
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,070
All right. Let's do it.

75
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,710
And... Action!

76
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,814
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget it, the platoon is gone!

77
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,852
- What?
- The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

78
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,562
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

79
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:34,358
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

80
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,829
Hang on.
Joey, you keep touching your face.

81
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,027
Something wrong?

82
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,698
No. No.

83
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,175
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

84
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,109
He's a face toucher.

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,051
I don't think so.

86
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,255
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,824
We may not have weapons,
but we still have food.

88
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,395
Potatoes, pasta...

89
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,498
...and a few tins of tuna!

90
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,127
Honey, we gotta go!

91
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,998
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

92
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,008
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearl necklaces?

93
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,238
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

94
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,416
No.

95
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,350
I just met him once,
but I'm guessing...

96
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,485
...plunging?

97
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:33,125
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
flaunt-it kind of father.

98
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,525
Let me see if Rachel has anything.

99
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,560
Yes, include more people in this.

100
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,400
Do you realize that at this time tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

101
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,502
I have a date tomorrow night.

102
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,970
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't sound so surprised.

103
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,543
I'm sorry, but...

104
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,946
- Nothing.
- What?

105
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,086
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

106
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,120
...I've been waiting for something
to flip you out.

107
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,917
Honestly? Me too.

108
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,892
- Really?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,792
I think that something
will come up and I'll go all...

110
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,466
Well, Chandler.

111
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,659
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

112
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,464
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

113
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,765
It's made me stay calm.

114
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,975
I could've been worse.

115
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,078
I'll be right there.

116
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,987
If you're calling before Saturday,
you've reached Monica and Chandler.

117
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:43,128
But if you're calling after Saturday,
you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.

118
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,127
Please leave a message
for... the Bings!

119
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,415
Hey, Maureen! Hi!

120
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,519
- This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

121
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,218
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

122
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,019
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

123
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,961
Monica.

124
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,898
So you know, I had my
"older brother" talk with Chandler.

125
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,366
What is that?

126
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,632
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

127
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,471
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

128
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,441
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

129
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,051
I would kick his ass!

130
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,648
Ross, please, my makeup!

131
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,852
- Chandler.
- Mom.

132
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,691
Thanks for wearing... something.

133
00:08:55,835 --> 00:09:00,568
This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

134
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,502
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

135
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,382
I can't believe I'm going back to work
to get spit on again.

136
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,317
You're lucky. At least the people
that spit on you are famous.

137
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,793
- Who spits on you?
- I don't want to talk about work.

138
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:28,131
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

139
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:32,098
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

140
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,828
Jack!

141
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,273
What? I've never seen one before.

142
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,740
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

143
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,075
I wasn't even able to act
like I'm okay with it.

144
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,052
Hello, all.

145
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,116
Hi... Dad.

146
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,654
Hi, Mr. Bing.

147
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,063
- Nora.
- Charles.

148
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,792
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

149
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,437
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

150
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,204
Aren't you a little old
to wear a dress like that?

151
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,338
Don't you have a little too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

152
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,646
Oh, my God.

153
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,783
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

154
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,257
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

155
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,659
Thanks, you guys.

156
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,430
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

157
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,334
Talk to Chandler's dad and
keep him away from Chandler's mom.

158
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,738
- But I don't know what he looks like.
- He's the man in the black dress.

159
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,384
Hi! I'm Rachel,
a friend of Monica and Chandler's.

160
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,581
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

161
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,886
"A man, duh!"

162
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,430
Could I have your attention?

163
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,565
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

164
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,342
Dad, please. As I was saying...

165
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,103
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

166
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,344
And I'm the best man.

167
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,113
And I have to say, I'm a little
surprised we're all here today.

168
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,587
For those of you
who don't know Chandler...

169
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,694
...he's not the biggest fan
of relationships.

170
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,591
In fact, I think
before he met Monica...

171
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,031
...the only real relationship he
had was with a girl named Molly.

172
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,435
And he would've married her,
only she couldn't control her bladder.

173
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,873
It was his dog.
Did I say it was his dog?

174
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,417
Any... Anyway...

175
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,152
This marriage is
doubly special for me...

176
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:09,259
...because not only is the groom
my best friend...

177
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,898
...but the bride is my little sister.

178
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,693
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

179
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,264
Please join me in raising a glass...

180
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,275
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

181
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,204
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

182
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:43,788
How cool is it that the next time you see
Chandler you'll be walking down the aisle?

183
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,591
I can't believe that after tomorrow
it's all gonna be over.

184
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,429
Honey, it's not gonna be over.
You're gonna be married to Chandler.

185
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,105
Maybe I can wear the
dress for Halloween!

186
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,743
I'm gonna steam my dress.

187
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,470
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

188
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,206
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

189
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,848
- I said, I'll do it.
- Nobody?

190
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:12,183
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

191
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,989
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

192
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,596
Thanks for helping my grandmother
get to the hotel safely.

193
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:23,768
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

194
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,169
What grandmother?

195
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,772
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

196
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,107
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

197
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,943
- Nice shades.
- Thanks.

198
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,087
I figure if I wear these in my scenes,
I won't get spit in my eyes.

199
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,851
And, if I remember correctly,
Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI.

200
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,492
Great! All right!

201
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,695
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

202
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,903
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room.

203
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,433
Chandler?

204
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,259
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

205
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,632
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

206
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:35,568
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry."

207
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,032
Oh, my God.

208
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,109
What's up?

209
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,613
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."

210
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,880
Tell her yourself.

211
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,659
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

212
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,364
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

213
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,399
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk."

214
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,800
Or "Tell Monica I'm sorry I used
her tweezers to pluck my nose hair."

215
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,466
He does that. I've seen him.

216
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:17,916
Or maybe he was writing to tell her
that he's changed his name:

217
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,052
"Tell Monica I'm Sorry."

218
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:28,552
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

219
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,892
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,902
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

221
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,505
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

222
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,142
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

223
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,437
But if you don't find him
and bring him back...

224
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,845
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

225
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,150
I will find him.

226
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,061
Well, the dress is done.

227
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,563
What?

228
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,531
We're just so happy for you.

229
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,997
That's so sweet!

230
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,703
Can we just take a minute and talk about
the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.

231
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,038
I mean, how lucky am I?

232
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,782
That's a good question.

233
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,077
I just hope that someday
you guys find someone like Chandler.

234
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,848
I hope we find someone exactly
like Chandler and soon.

235
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,830
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

236
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,899
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

237
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,331
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

238
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,105
I found the picture!

239
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,139
Picture? What picture?

240
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,250
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.

241
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,947
- Could you lower the script?
- I don't want to.

242
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,984
I need to see your face
so I can play off your reaction.

243
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,157
Okay, look.

244
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,892
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

245
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,434
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

246
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,338
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

247
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,543
That's what real actors do.

248
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,914
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

249
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,016
And when you enunciate, you spit!

250
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,879
Didn't know that.

251
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,422
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

252
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,658
Picture? What picture?

253
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,572
- Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

254
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,710
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

255
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,539
Yes. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

256
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,309
- We'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

257
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,946
Then we'll see you
the day after tomorrow.

258
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,152
Mom? Dad?

259
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,386
What are you doing here?

260
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,191
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is all about.

261
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,767
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

262
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,495
The sexy blond behind the counter.

263
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,741
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

264
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,345
- What? Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

265
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,021
I know what the list is.

266
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,817
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.

267
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,394
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.

268
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,860
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

269
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,298
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

270
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,872
Action!

271
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,770
I found the picture!

272
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,378
What picture?

273
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,420
The picture of my wife, in your pack!

274
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,718
You went through my personal property?

275
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,224
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

276
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,596
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

277
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,600
...for two years!

278
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,364
Cut! Wonderful!

279
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,202
Great scene!

280
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,506
You were awesome. In that
last speech, you soaked me.

281
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,585
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

282
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,017
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

283
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,156
I have plans. Important plans!

284
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,858
- Ross said still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

285
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,369
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th Avenue.

286
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,172
Okay, well, there's one down.

287
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,907
I'm getting married today!

288
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,313
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

289
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,751
My day is finally here!

290
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,224
She might not even notice he's gone.

291
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,622
I'm gonna start getting ready!

292
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,302
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

293
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,735
But she'll be in the gown
and then he won't show up...

294
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,570
...then she'll have
to take off the gown...

295
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,245
Stop it. You can't do this here.

296
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

297
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,850
It's just so sad.

298
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,885
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

299
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,991
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know. Oh, God!

300
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,751
There's no tissue.

301
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,122
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

302
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,198
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

303
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,401
- I found one.
- Okay.

304
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,601
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

305
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,605
Oh, God.

306
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,076
Can I have another one?

307
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,341
Sure.

308
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,218
Do you need some floss?

309
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,253
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

310
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,121
Here's a whole bunch.

311
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,593
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

312
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,165
...and people will be whispering,
"Oh, that poor girl."

313
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,531
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

314
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,603
- Oh, my God.
- What?

315
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,903
There was a pregnancy test in the
garbage. And it's positive.

316
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,978
Monica's pregnant.

317
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,275
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

318
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,013
Oh, my God!

319
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,422
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!

320
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,359
Can this count as her "something new"?

321
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,496
Oh, my God.

322
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,628
Do you think this is why
Chandler took off?

323
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:25,673
She had to have just taken that test.
I took out the trash last night.

324
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,209
It's turning into
the worst wedding ever.

325
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,781
The bride's pregnant, the groom's
missing and I'm still holding this.

326
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:38,179
Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone
about this.

327
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,551
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay?

328
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,024
Hey, wait. Do you know
what kind of birth control she uses?

329
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,218
No. Why?

330
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,127
Just for the future.
This is hardly a commercial for it.

331
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,804
Anything?

332
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,272
No. I talked to Joey on the set.
He hasn't heard from him.

333
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,810
I talked to Chandler's parents again.

334
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,242
You said he was missing?

335
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,009
No. I made it seem
like I called to chat.

336
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,415
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested in them.

337
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,089
- We've got to tell her he's gone.
- No, we can't.

338
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,383
She'll start getting ready soon.

339
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,723
Can't you stall her? I'll go back
to the places I went last night.

340
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,090
How much time?

341
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,028
How long before she absolutely
has to start getting ready?

342
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,634
- One hour.
- Give me two.

343
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,838
Then why do you ask?

344
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,674
- Wish me luck.
- I'm going with you.

345
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,301
Why?

346
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,914
You're tired. You looked all night.
And, clearly, you suck at this.

347
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,141
I have documented night blindness.

348
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,108
No, you don't!

349
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,379
Okay. But I don't suck!

350
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,779
See you later.

351
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,050
Do you know how
you're gonna stall her?

352
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,490
Because she is insane
about her schedule today.

353
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,823
- I'll figure something out.
- Okay, good luck.

354
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,493
I thought we'd start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

355
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,435
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to talk to me.

356
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,265
About what?

357
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,106
I'm never gonna get married!

358
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,250
You will. The right guy's
just around the corner.

359
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,454
Okay, are we done with that?

360
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,916
No, I'm serious.

361
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:24,125
Maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.

362
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,455
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

363
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,530
Maybe I'd feel better
if I slept with Joey.

364
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,568
Rachel? Are you okay?

365
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:42,979
Excuse me, Aaron? I have
a little problem with the schedule.

366
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:47,811
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

367
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,647
It's my best friend's
and I'm officiating...

368
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,687
...so I really can't work past 4.

369
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:58,088
You've gotta stay until the end.
We can't stop filming just for you.

370
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,457
It's not like it's your wedding.

371
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,724
It is my wedding.

372
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,902
Did I not make that clear?

373
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,328
You said your best friend
is getting married.

374
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,801
Yeah, to me.

375
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,602
Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend.
Isn't that beautiful?

376
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,073
- But you said you were officiating.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,684
- Your own wedding?
- Happens more than you think.

378
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,310
I'm sorry, Joey. It's still no.

379
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,920
I'm having surgery.

380
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,317
What?

381
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,792
I made up the stuff about the wedding
because I didn't want you to worry.

382
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,760
But I'm having surgery today.

383
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,499
What kind of surgery?

384
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,402
Transplant.

385
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,574
But you're supposed to work on Monday.

386
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,176
Hair transplant.

387
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,842
But you're not bald.

388
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,806
It's not on my head.

389
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:58,814
There's nothing I can do.
You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.

390
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,357
We've just got one short scene, it's
just you and Richard and he's a pro.

391
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,426
You'll be fine.

392
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,429
Morning, Richard.

393
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,534
Hey, you're here! Great!
Let's go, buddy!

394
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,862
We got a scene to shoot!

395
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,306
I'm wearing two belts.

396
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,637
- Are you drunk?
- No.

397
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,778
Yes, you are!

398
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,181
All right.

399
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:33,414
We are never gonna find him.
He's one guy in a huge city.

400
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,018
Oh, my God. Is that him?

401
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,659
That is an old Chinese woman.

402
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,427
He could be in disguise, you know.

403
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,836
You know what? You're right.
You're absolutely right.

404
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,802
Wait a minute.

405
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,937
Chandler!

406
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,678
Now you're thinking.

407
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,280
Maybe we're just approaching
this all wrong.

408
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,678
If you're Chandler
and you want to hide...

409
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,946
...where is the last place on Earth
people would think you'd go?

410
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,657
So this is your office.

411
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,559
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I should've hid at the gym.

412
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,730
- What the hell are you doing?
- Panicking.

413
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,926
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm related to Monica.

414
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,039
- How is she?
- She doesn't know you're gone.

415
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,770
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

416
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,244
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

417
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,408
Because if I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.

418
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,343
I can't be the Bings.

419
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,953
What's wrong with it?

420
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,020
The Bings have horrible marriages.

421
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,452
They yell, they fight...

422
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,391
...and they use the pool boy
as a pawn in their sexual games.

423
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:50,960
Have you ever put on a black dress
and asked me up to your hotel room?

424
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,432
- No.
- Then you are neither of your parents.

425
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,139
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

426
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,179
Only Paul Newman
can make marriage work.

427
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,282
And I've met me.
I am no Paul Newman.

428
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:11,217
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

429
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,188
But look, Chandler...

430
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,086
...right now no one has
a lower opinion of you than I do.

431
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,355
But I totally believe you can do this.

432
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,664
I want to. I love her so much,
but I'm afraid...

433
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:28,631
This is too huge.

434
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,740
You're right. It is huge.

435
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:34,469
So why don't we take it
just a little bit at a time.

436
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,580
Forget getting married for a sec.
Just forget about it.

437
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,343
Can you just come home
and take a shower?

438
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,515
Well, yeah. But then...

439
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,722
We're just gonna go home
and take a shower.

440
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,862
That's not scary, right?

441
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,697
Depends on what you mean by "we."

442
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,692
- All right!
- There he is!

443
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,099
Good old Chandler
with the homophobic jokes.

444
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,603
So, what do you say?

445
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,233
I'll shower,
but I won't promise anything.

446
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:09,903
Okay, that's all we're talking about.
Okay? Come on, let's go home.

447
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,975
Who's Mike Smith?

448
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,354
I was sure this was my office.

449
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,653
The nights are the hardest.

450
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,988
But then the day comes...

451
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,530
...and that's every bit as hard
as the night.

452
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,897
- Then the night comes again...
- The days and nights are hard, I get it!

453
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,667
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

454
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,206
I know. At dusk.

455
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,745
That's such a hard time for me.

456
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,852
I'm gonna put my makeup on.
We have to be at the hotel in an hour.

457
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,452
- Wait!
- What?

458
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,748
Let's go to lunch!

459
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,649
I can't go to lunch!

460
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,282
Right.

461
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,230
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.

462
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,328
What's going on?

463
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,598
All right, honey, listen.

464
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,309
When I tell you what I'm about to
tell you, I need you to remember...

465
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,778
...that we are all here for you
and that we love you.

466
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,178
Okay, you're really freaking me out.

467
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,282
We can't find Chandler...

468
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,991
...'s vest.

469
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,795
We can't find Chandler's vest.

470
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,554
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?

471
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,357
Found the vest.

472
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:40,561
We'll have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't lose it again.

473
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,167
Okay, don't scare me like that, okay?

474
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,579
For a minute, I was like,
"Oh, my God! The worst has happened!"

475
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,116
I would sooner die in this hellhole
than see her back with you!

476
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,290
That can be arranged.

477
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,318
- Let's reset.
- What?! He got me!

478
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,400
Let's take it from there.

479
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,833
Are you a little off today?
It's going terribly slowly.

480
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,836
Look, my best friends are getting
married in, like, an hour, okay?

481
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,137
And I'm the minister.
Please, can you pull it together?

482
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,317
Of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss
anything like that on account of me.

483
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,020
- I can do this.
- Thank you. Thank you.

484
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,281
Still rolling. And, action.

485
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,458
I would sooner die in this hellhole
than see her back with you!

486
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,924
That can be arranged!

487
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,489
Slippery little bugger!

488
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,677
So you two were married, huh?

489
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,408
What happened, you just drift apart?

490
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,080
Do you remember our wedding day?

491
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,088
Did you know I slept with the best man?

492
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,625
Yes, he told me.

493
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,295
At least I think that was what he said.

494
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:17,901
It was difficult to understand
with his legs wrapped around my head.

495
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,998
Here comes the bride.

496
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,710
Oh, my God, Monica!

497
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,514
I want to wear this every day.

498
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,685
You look so beautiful.

499
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,648
I'm so happy for me.

500
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,425
- Hello?
- Did Chandler show up yet?

501
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,031
- We got him back. Everything's fine.
- Damn it!

502
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,827
- Where are you?
- I'm still on the set.

503
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,834
The wedding is in less than an hour.

504
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,669
I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't let me go until we get this.

505
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,244
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

506
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,948
No, I'm the minister!

507
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,482
Look, put them both on the phone,
I'll marry them right now.

508
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,687
Joey, I have to go.

509
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,415
Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you
and me right now! I have the power!

510
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,523
There you go! You put on a tuxedo!

511
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,032
That wasn't scary, was it?

512
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,928
No.

513
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,607
I'm telling you,
just a little bit at a time.

514
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,904
What's the next little bit?

515
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,909
Getting married.

516
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:40,778
You can do that too.
Just like you've done everything else.

517
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,817
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.

518
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:50,090
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Where you going?

519
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,752
I'm not gonna run away again.
I just want some fresh air.

520
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,564
- Okay.
- Okay.

521
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,841
Oh, fresh air!

522
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,343
- Cover for me.
- Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.

523
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,541
We gotta do something.

524
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:19,280
Joey won't make it, so I'll look around
the hotel for other weddings.

525
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,051
Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

526
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,392
Okay.

527
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,937
Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding.
Excellent.

528
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,706
Congratulations.

529
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,472
Mazel tov.

530
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,946
Hi! Oh, great hat.

531
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,819
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

532
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,856
I don't know.
Are they Greek Orthodox?

533
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,617
Yeah. Yeah.

534
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:01,094
They're my friends,
Monica Stephanopolis.

535
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,458
And Chandler Acidophilus.

536
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,304
Hi. Hi.

537
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,407
Hi.

538
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,778
Has anyone seen Chandler?

539
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,919
- I thought he was with you.
- He was with me.

540
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,679
We're playing a little game.
Hide-and-seek.

541
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,620
You can't ask us, son.
That's cheating.

542
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,858
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

543
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,730
He better not come here. He can't see
the bride in her wedding dress.

544
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:44,999
As I recall, when we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

545
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,174
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad luck then.

546
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,439
Honey, it isn't good luck.

547
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,555
Oh, my God! Monica.

548
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,417
I know!

549
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,689
- How's Chandler doing?
- Great.

550
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,126
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about Chandler.

551
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,189
Are you okay?

552
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,501
Well, you're sweating.

553
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,006
Out of happiness for you and Chandler.

554
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,200
These are beads of joy.

555
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,073
That's sweet.

556
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,907
Don't touch me.

557
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,248
- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
- Yeah.

558
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,116
- What's going on?
- Chandler's gone again.

559
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:41,697
Why would you play hide-and-seek
with someone you know is a flight risk?

560
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,801
Aaron, you gotta let me go.
The guy's hammered.

561
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:53,672
I'm sorry. As long as he's here
and conscious, we're still shooting.

562
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,182
You wouldn't happen to have
a very big fork?

563
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,418
So I just talked to the director.

564
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,358
That's it. We're done for the day.

565
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,831
We finished the scene?

566
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,527
- You were wonderful.
- As were you.

567
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,872
So I got your car. It's right outside.

568
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,599
Why? Are we done for the day?

569
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,409
That's what you told me.

570
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,641
Thank you. You're welcome.

571
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:37,279
No, we gotta go. Come on.
Here we go.

572
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,086
Is that my ass?

573
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,762
- There he is!
- What?

574
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,370
You're not getting
away this time, mister!

575
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,598
Unless you want
that ass-kicking we talked about!

576
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,367
Ross!

577
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,447
I'm serious! You're not
walking out on my sister!

578
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,414
That's right. I'm not.

579
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,986
- Then where have you been?
- I know about Monica.

580
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,022
- You know?
- What?

581
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,818
I heard you and Rachel talking.

582
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,655
- What? Talking about what?
- You don't know?

583
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,196
If somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on right now...

584
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,062
What, you'll "hi-yah"?

585
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,765
Monica's pregnant.

586
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,267
Oh, my God.

587
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,012
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?

588
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,013
I was. Then I went to the gift shop
because I was out of cigarettes.

589
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,345
- Cigarettes?
- Big picture, please!

590
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:49,016
So when I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this.

591
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:54,891
And I thought, "Anything
that can fit into this can't be scary."

592
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,160
You obviously didn't see Chucky III.

593
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,802
But come on, look at how cute
and small this is.

594
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,501
So I got it to give Monica
so she'd know I was okay.

595
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,043
Dude.

596
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,409
Way to go, son.
I knew you'd find him.

597
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,620
Our little boy is getting married.

598
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,695
Look at you, so handsome.

599
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,058
You look beautiful, Mom.

600
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,264
You look beautiful too, Dad.

601
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,437
I love you both.

602
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,642
I'm so glad you're here.

603
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,713
Are you Chandler?

604
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,420
Are you Joey?

605
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,161
- This is nice.
- What?

606
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,697
I've never walked down the aisle
knowing it can't end in divorce.

607
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,241
I wish your grandmother
had lived to see this.

608
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:26,412
- She's right there.
- Not that old crone. My mother.

609
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,053
Congratulations, darling.

610
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,263
We love you, sweetheart.

611
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,070
You look beautiful.

612
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,270
- Is this new?
- Not now.

613
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,843
- Who's this?
- I'm Father Karabasos.

614
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,779
He's Greek Orthodox.

615
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,208
As are you.

616
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,877
Let us begin.

617
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,148
Dearly beloved...

618
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,585
That's my line!

619
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,330
I can take it from here. Thanks.

620
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:15,066
Dearly beloved,
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

621
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,408
You may be confused by this now...

622
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,240
...but you won't be
Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

623
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,443
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

624
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,821
We are gathered here today...

625
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,321
...to join this man...

626
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:46,031
...and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

627
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:52,102
I've known Monica and Chandler
for a long time, and I cannot imagine...

628
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,643
...two people more perfect
for each other.

629
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:02,419
And now, as I've left my notes
in my dressing room...

630
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,120
...we shall proceed to the vows.
Monica?

631
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,716
- He took off?
- Go on. Go on.

632
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,265
Chandler, for so long...

633
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,240
...I wondered if I would ever
find my prince.

634
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,370
My soul mate.

635
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,375
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...

636
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,140
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

637
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:37,184
And instead I found everything that
I'd ever been looking for my whole life.

638
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,651
And now...

639
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,417
...here we are...

640
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,594
...with our future before us.

641
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,433
And I only want to spend it with you.

642
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,530
My prince.

643
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,569
My soul mate.

644
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,736
My friend.

645
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,136
Unless you don't want to.

646
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,615
You go.

647
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:09,985
Chandler?

648
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,383
No, that's okay.

649
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,728
I thought this would be the most
difficult thing I ever had to do.

650
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:27,433
But when I saw you walking down
that aisle, I realized it's simple.

651
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,269
I love you.

652
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:38,037
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I will always love you.

653
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,843
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my life with.

654
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,616
You want to know if I'm sure?

655
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,791
You may now kiss the bride.

656
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,003
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the state of New York...

657
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,570
...and the Internet guys...

658
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,775
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

659
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,846
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

660
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,147
- I do.
- I do.

661
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,852
Yeah, you do!

662
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,343
Rings.

663
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,250
Oh, crap. Okay.

664
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,584
Let's do the rings.

665
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,869
We good? Yeah? Good?

666
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,699
Once again...

667
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,241
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

668
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,845
Now kiss her again.

669
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,993
I love you.

670
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,133
And I know about the baby.

671
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,933
- What baby?
- Our baby.

672
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,866
We have a baby?

673
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,639
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

674
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,968
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

675
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,941
Then who did?

676
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,543
Look at them.

677
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,817
And they're gonna have a baby.
