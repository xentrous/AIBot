1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,235
It is true what they say:

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,202
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:16,708
I'm so pregnant that
my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,441
So I'm going to play my songs
on this drum.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,550
It sounds really cool!

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,052
Listen, listen.

7
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,124
Smelly cat, smelly cat

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,762
What are they feeding you?

9
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:39,998
That sounds great!

10
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,573
I know! And I've only
been playing for an hour.

11
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:52,445
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you a big favor.

12
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,388
Don't tell me you want to keep
more stuff in my uterus.

13
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,787
Okay. Now, see.

14
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,725
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

15
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:08,661
And Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

16
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,562
...Frank Jr., Jr.

17
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,838
Wouldn't that be Frank lll?

18
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,901
Don't get me started.

19
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,738
Anyway, since there
are three babies...

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,471
...and we both got
to put our names in...

21
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:28,177
...we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

22
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,087
That's so nice!

23
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,783
Cougar.

24
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,125
Think about it.

25
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,434
The One with Rachel's New Dress

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,648
I left a bra drying in there.

27
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,578
Will your son think it's yours
and be traumatized?

28
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,654
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

29
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,788
It's time to go.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,621
See, that clock's a little fast.

31
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,127
We still have 17 minutes.

32
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,229
What can we do in 17 minutes...

33
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,833
...twice?

34
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,896
Well, that's ambitious.

35
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,138
You can ignore that.

36
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,706
That's your son.

37
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,880
Believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

38
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,683
I'll be right there.

39
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,093
This is Carol and Susan.

40
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,355
-It's so nice to finally meet you.
-You too.

41
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,160
-Susan will be in London next week.
-I've never been there.

42
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,199
-I'll show you around.
-Great!

43
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,666
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?

44
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,807
There's tons of terrific stuff.

45
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,934
I'll go with you.

46
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,608
Look at you two bonding.

47
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,544
Making us late for the airport.

48
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,375
Are you all right?

49
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,921
It's just us getting along
is difficult for him...

50
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,421
...because he doesn't like me.

51
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,584
Come on. That's...

52
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,056
It's true.

53
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,335
How did we lose?

54
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,776
Do we have a baby name yet?

55
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,279
No. It's so hard!

56
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,847
I went through this book
and found nothing.

57
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,522
I want a name that's
really strong and confident.

58
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,814
You know? Like...Exxon!

59
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,622
It certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.

60
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,694
You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

61
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:34,497
I'm not sure about Hulk,
but I like a name starting with "The".

62
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,273
You want a good name,
go with Joey.

63
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,343
Joey's your pal, your buddy.

64
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,841
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!

65
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,678
If you're going to name him Joey,
you should name him Chandler.

66
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,813
Chandler's funny, sophisticated,
and very lovable...

67
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,358
...once you get to know him.

68
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,685
Joey's lovable too.

69
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,492
But with Joey, if you need him,
he'll be there.

70
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,728
Chandler will be there too.
He might be a little late...

71
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,970
...but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you cold soda...

72
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,336
...if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

73
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,142
What do you say?

74
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,750
I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

75
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,250
Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

76
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,189
All right, I don't

77
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,728
Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.

78
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,497
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I wanted to name my kid that.

79
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,569
If you hoped to sleep with Joshua,
which one would you wear?

80
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,815
It creeps me out choosing
other people's sex clothes.

81
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,146
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

82
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,356
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair colored.

83
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,151
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

84
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,090
What am I making him, by the way?

85
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,795
A frisee salad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

86
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,935
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

87
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,296
I thought I was making him
filet mignon.

88
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,574
You decided to make salmon
because you had some left over.

89
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,975
Then you realized if you bitched,
then you would stop cooking...

90
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,481
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,618
I really get crabby when I cook.

92
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,957
Why go through all this trouble?
He's a guy.

93
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,119
You'd serve the potato and he'd
still want to have sex with you.

94
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,197
That is not how I operate.

95
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,343
We've got to get a new game.

96
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,139
So Emily called last night.

97
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,908
And now you're giving me the message?

98
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,823
Turns out that Emily is
just crazy about Susan.

99
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,921
They're going
to the theater together.

100
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,459
They're going to dinner.

101
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,860
They're going horseback riding!

102
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,166
God, Susan is so fun!

103
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,506
Look, this is just
a little too familiar.

104
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,872
For six months
before Carol and I split up...

105
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:33,312
...all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart.

106
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,615
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."

107
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,787
You think something could happen
between Emily and Susan?

108
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,895
Hey, they're going
to the gym together!

109
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,056
Two women...

110
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,961
...stretching!

111
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,336
They take a steam, things get playful.
Didn't you see Personal Best?

112
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,406
No, but I'm gonna!

113
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,042
Hi! You're crazy.

114
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,979
Emily is straight.

115
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,687
How do you know?
We thought Carol was straight.

116
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,689
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

117
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,720
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down!

118
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,932
No, I meant for the baby.

119
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,029
What's wrong with Ross?

120
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,703
Something like this would never
happen to The Hulk, you know.

121
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,380
That's not true.

122
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,575
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found...

123
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,843
You know...

124
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,580
Never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

125
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:52,061
I'm definitely going to go
with either Joey or Chandler.

126
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,962
You gotta pick Joey!

127
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,736
Name one famous person
named Chandler.

128
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,193
Raymond Chandler.

129
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,635
Someone you didn't make up.

130
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,740
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for...

131
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,376
...Joey Buttafucco.

132
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,281
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

133
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,648
How about a compromise then?
What if it's...

134
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,719
...Chan-no-ey?

135
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,490
Joey? Think about it.
He'll never be President.

136
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,161
There will never be a President Joey.

137
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,989
I didn't want to bring this up.

138
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:31,293
Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life!

139
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,405
It's not a name!
It's barely even a word.

140
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,598
It's like chandelier
but it's not!

141
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,469
Then, you put it together with Bing
and forget about it.

142
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,379
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

143
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,623
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

144
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,661
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

145
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,832
So I guess it's Joey then.

146
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,175
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

147
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,411
Please! Cooking soothes me.

148
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,885
So dig in!

149
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,258
It all looks so good.

150
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,419
Oh, my God.

151
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,100
I know.
My God, this rice is so

152
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,198
I am so good!

153
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,470
Behind you.

154
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,635
They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

155
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,542
Is there some way
that they could not be here?

156
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,615
Farm birds really
kind of freak me out!

157
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,248
Here we go.

158
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,755
There you go!

159
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,403
Hey! How'd you do that?

160
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,178
All gone.

161
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,909
So, farm birds, huh?

162
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,312
It's my only weird thing, I swear.

163
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,419
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.

164
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,597
Can I serve you a little

165
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,095
What?

166
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,323
Nothing.

167
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,596
It's just that I know
that they're still out there.

168
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,500
They're across the hall.
That's two doors away.

169
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,543
It'll take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

170
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,341
That's not funny.

171
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,123
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

172
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,226
We could pack this stuff up
and go to your apartment.

173
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,488
They're working on it.
It's a mess.

174
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,701
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

175
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,531
They're out of town.

176
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,167
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view.

177
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,138
It'd be very romantic.

178
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,979
-What do you say?
-Yeah, that works.

179
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,748
They can smell the fear.

180
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,549
How's Ben?

181
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,886
I asked if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

182
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,527
I asked if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

183
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,528
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

184
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,530
So he's sweeping.

185
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,067
Any word from Susan?

186
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,535
She said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

187
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,540
By the by, did it
ever occur to you that...

188
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,879
...maybe they might be having
a little too much fun?

189
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,387
What's too much fun?

190
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,083
The kind of fun you and Susan had
when we were married.

191
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,456
Oh, my God!
You are so paranoid.

192
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,097
Am I?

193
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,626
Am I?

194
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,563
Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

195
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,275
Carol, so were we.

196
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,472
Just imagine for a moment...

197
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,406
...that Susan meets someone,
and they hit it off.

198
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,110
They're coming back from the theater,
and they stop at a pub for drinks.

199
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,652
They're laughing.

200
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,155
Someone innocently
touches someone else.

201
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,559
There's electricity.

202
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,627
It's new. It's exciting.

203
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,358
Are you saying there isn't
the slightest possibility...

204
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,431
...of something happening?

205
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,369
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God!

206
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,097
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it!

207
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,044
None of the other kids believed me,
but I swear that duck pushed me.

208
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,784
This place is fabulous!

209
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,889
This is the downstairs living room.

210
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,854
There's two living rooms?

211
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:26,657
Growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

212
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,357
It would have been,
but my parents just moved here.

213
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,901
You should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

214
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,807
Want to make out?

215
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:42,079
Why don't I put the food
in the fridge...

216
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,816
...and we can eat it later?

217
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,008
That sounds like a plan.

218
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,052
Is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

219
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:54,816
Just down the hall
and second door to your left.

220
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,998
-Hi, darling.
-What are you doing here?

221
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,000
-We cut the trip short.
-France sucks!

222
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,933
This may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

223
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,164
Say no more.

224
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,709
We'll grab some food, go upstairs
and be out of your hair.

225
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,708
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to Italy?

226
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,010
Yep. Sucks!

227
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,933
Hi, you!

228
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,436
Oh, my God!

229
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,741
I know. I can do more than cook.

230
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,486
I like her. She seems smart.

231
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,229
Rachel, my parents.

232
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,525
So nice to meet you.

233
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:17,071
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

234
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:23,546
What, this? Oh, no.
That's not what it is.

235
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,046
Okay, I work in fashion.

236
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,810
And this is a real dress, actually.

237
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,922
They're wearing it in Milan.

238
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,255
Part of my job is to wear the clothes
and see how people respond.

239
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,092
Then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's.

240
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,159
Obviously, in this case...

241
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,996
...I am going to report back:

242
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,471
"U.S.A. not ready."

243
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,236
Maybe in L.A.

244
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,404
There you go!

245
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,445
Have you kids eaten yet?

246
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,382
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.

247
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,250
Why don't we all
get something to eat?

248
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,462
No use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

249
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,024
So we'll go eat.

250
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,929
You'll wear that.

251
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,669
We'll be eating and,
of course, you'll be wearing that.

252
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,337
I am sorry about what I said.

253
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,605
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name!

254
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,438
It's not bad.

255
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,947
Yes, it is!

256
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,887
From now on, I have no first name.

257
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,052
You're just Bing?

258
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,860
I have no name.

259
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,825
So what are we supposed to call you?

260
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,459
Okay, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

261
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,802
...Clint.

262
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,202
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint."

263
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,674
What name am I
cool enough to pull off?

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,669
Gene.

265
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,673
It's Clint.

266
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,386
It's Clint!

267
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,581
Bye, Gene.

268
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,320
It's Clint!

269
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,128
What's up with Gene?

270
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,367
You wore your nightie to dinner?

271
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,369
The best part was when the waiter
spilled water down my back.

272
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,442
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

273
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,615
It's all right.
I got nice boobs.

274
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,478
I just picked up
a message from Emily.

275
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,981
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

276
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,419
-So?
-So?

277
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,323
Poetry?

278
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,620
Susan's gay.

279
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,126
They're being gay together!

280
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,224
Emily's straight.

281
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,404
Oh, wake up!

282
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,940
Carol really messed you up.

283
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,472
Excuse me?

284
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,772
She turned you into
this untrusting, crazy, jealous...

285
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,041
...sycophant!

286
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,748
So I don't know what "sycophant" means,
but the rest is right.

287
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,053
What are you talking about?
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

288
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,130
She's right.

289
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,132
When we were together, you got upset
about Mark, and there was nothing.

290
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,666
This makes sense.

291
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,397
It does not!

292
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,269
In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

293
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,447
...even though all your girlfriends
cheated on you.

294
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,247
So up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

295
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:52,253
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam! Paranoid City!

296
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,922
Absolutely!

297
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,490
This is so fun!

298
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,528
This is not fun!

299
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,323
All we're trying to say is...

300
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:07,028
...don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

301
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,464
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

302
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,010
I still think I was right
about that Mark thing.

303
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,716
Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

304
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,827
Drumroll.

305
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,198
All right.

306
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,790
Help!

307
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,205
Am I a Mark or a John?

308
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,733
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

309
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,876
But you might make a good Barney.

310
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,011
Look, I am serious.

311
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,547
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going
to the courthouse.

312
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,343
You're going through with this?

313
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,078
This name has held me back
my entire life.

314
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:01,190
It's why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

315
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,226
So tomorrow, I'll either be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

316
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,825
You've got problems because of you,
not your name!

317
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,667
This has got to stop!
Chandler is a great name.

318
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,341
In fact...

319
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:24,113
I'm sorry, I know you wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

320
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,875
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.

321
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:31,878
Really?

322
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,081
But you have to keep the name too.

323
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,552
Okay, thanks!

324
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,422
You want to hug it out?

325
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,467
I'm going to go tell
Frank and Alice right now!

326
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,761
Bye, Pheebs!

327
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,658
-Nice luggage.
-I was going to say.

328
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,367
I missed you too.

329
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,063
-Thanks, I had a great time.
-So did I.

330
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,032
No tongue.
