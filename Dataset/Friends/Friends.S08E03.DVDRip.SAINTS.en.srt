1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,880
Aren't you excited we're going
on our honeymoon?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,280
Yeah, I am.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,920
That's right, get it out of your system
while we're alone.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,560
-Hey. We came to say goodbye.
-Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,480
-Thanks.
-I better go pack.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,160
No, I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,720
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm gonna go pack my regular,
long bathing suit.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,560
Good, you're still here! I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,200
Thank you!

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,400
And I also wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,240
What? What?

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,160
-We know it's Ross.
-How? How do you know?

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,200
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,520
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I am so relieved that you guys know!

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
That is so great. And I'm gonna be
your baby's aunt!

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,400
I know.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,080
Me too!

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,320
And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,080
-You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
-Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,880
So now that you all know, you can help me.
Give me some advice on how to tell Ross.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,320
What were you gonna say?

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have it,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Well, that sounds good.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,960
Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
I mean, what's the first thing that I say?

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,720
-Okay, great. Thanks.
-Hey, good luck.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,520
Yeah, bye.

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,160
Hey, what was that all about?

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,480
Guess there's no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,080
What?! I didn't even know that..!
Why didn't you tell me?

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
Why am I talking like this?

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,600
-I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
-What?!

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
What?!

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,000
I am an excellent secret-keeper.
I have kept all our secrets.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
-What secrets?
-No, no, Joey.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm not gonna tell you, because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,760
-You'll tell me later?
-You already know.

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,040
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,400
You know, Monica and Chandler are
married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
-Maybe you and I should do something.
-All in good time, my love. All in good time.

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,040
Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later, right?

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

43
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,640
-What? They took mine to give to you.
-Why would they take away our keys?

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
Maybe they don't trust us.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,200
They let me keep my key the last time
they were out of town.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,040
The time you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?

47
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,000
-Hey, I washed those.
-No, you didn't.

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,360
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,360
-What will I do? I really need my guitar.
-I have stuff in there too.

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,880
-What stuff?
-Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of it.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,680
Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,000
Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency!

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,600
Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
-Hey, did Monica and Chandler take off yet?
-Yeah.

55
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,160
Damn. They left without my pass to the
Nassau Fossil and Natural History Museum.

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,040
There goes the honeymoon.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,640
-Did Rachel find you?
-No, why?

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,360
She was looking for you.

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,360
Well, I guess I'll catch up
with her later.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,640
-She really wanted to talk to you now.
-Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

61
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
Oh, no.

62
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,400
I think I might know what this is about.

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
Really?

65
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,120
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this, but..

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,880
About a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
And?

68
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Wow, I thought you'd be
a little more shocked.

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
Oh, sorry. And?!

70
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,440
Well, we said we'd just do it
that one time..

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,320
but now I think she may wanna
start things up again.

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,080
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,800
-Why? What else could it be?
-Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm telling you, that's what it is.

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,640
No wonder she was looking at me
all funny during the wedding.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
She didn't say anything to you?

77
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,440
-Maybe it's something you ate.
-Could be, yeah.

78
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,000
-Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
-Yeah, I guess I should.

79
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,680
Man, you know what I have to realize?

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,440
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,960
You know, they always seem
to want a little bit more.

82
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,480
I should remember that.

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,320
Next.

84
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,640
-They're kissing. Let's just go around them.
-Leave them alone. They're in love.

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm in love too. But
in an orderly fashion.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
Next.

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,360
Hi. Can you do that and walk?
Because she said, "Next."

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,240
Let me see what I can do. There
are some first-class seats available.

90
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,880
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon!

91
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,360
-Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
-We are on our honeymoon.

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
Grab my ass.

93
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,480
-Next.
-Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,840
You know, I'm just so in love with my
new husband. We're on our honeymoon.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

96
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

97
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,600
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing and bump us to first class?

98
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are
taken. That couple got the last two.

99
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,040
See? If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!

100
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,880
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

101
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,640
I still can't believe they took away my
key. I mean, you trust me with yours.

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,280
Of course I do!
And I'm gonna get it back to you..

103
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,960
just as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

104
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,640
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

105
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
Treeger, what are you doing?

106
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,760
-You said there was a gas leak.
-Why not use your key?

107
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,240
By the time I found it on this thing,
the whole place might have exploded.

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,920
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will ask questions.

109
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,680
Come on, hurry up!

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,800
Well, we could have done that.

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,840
Look at that! They're going
into the first-class lounge.

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,920
-Do you know what they have in there?
-No.

113
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
Me neither. We have to get in!

114
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,720
-Just act like you belong.
-Oh, my God! Oranges!

115
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,960
-Nice to see you again.
-Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

116
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,360
Yes, of course.

117
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,880
Would you move your thumb?
I can't see the seat number.

118
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,000
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

119
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,360
-Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
-Apology accepted. Excuse us.

120
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,680
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

121
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,040
Fine.

122
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,560
Go, go!

123
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,080
-Hi.
-Hi.

124
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
Hi.

125
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,160
I think there's something
that we really need to talk about.

126
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,240
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.

127
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,240
-Look, I know why you're here.
-You do?

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,480
Yeah, and to save you
from any embarrassment..

129
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
I think maybe I should talk first.

130
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,000
-Okay.
-Okay?

131
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,440
Ross and Rachel.

132
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,560
Rachel and Ross.

133
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,040
That's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
What?

135
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,160
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

136
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,600
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

137
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
Seriously, what?

138
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,320
Okay. You know what?

139
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,080
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

140
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,120
I mean, I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now..

141
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
Okay.

142
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
You know what? Can I talk now?

143
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,360
-Oh, sure.
-Okay.

144
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm pregnant.

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
Ross?

146
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,920
Ross?

147
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,640
Okay, whenever you're ready.

148
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,200
And you're the father, by the way.
But you got..

149
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,480
-Can I get you some water?
-I'm good.

150
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,880
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? I
mean, you can be as involved as you want.

151
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,520
Yeah, I..

152
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand..

153
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,960
how this happened.

154
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,680
-We used a condom.
-I know.

155
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,760
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

156
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
What?

157
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
What?!

158
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,080
Well, they should put that on the box!

159
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
-They do.
-No, they don't!

160
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,880
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

161
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,200
-Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.
-Well, I may as well have!

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,600
Listen, you know what?
I was really freaked out too..

163
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,440
-when I found out.
-Freaked..? Hey, I'm not freaked out.

164
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm indignant as a consumer!

165
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,200
-You know what? Let's talk later.
-No, I wanna talk now.

166
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,440
In fact, I wanna talk..

167
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,600
to the president
of the condom company.

168
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,120
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should come back.. Okay.

169
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,520
Yeah, I'll press one!

170
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,720
-I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
-So then I can heat this up?

171
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
Anyway, I'll get moving
on that new door.

172
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,480
Great. Listen, could you do us a favor and
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

173
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,200
Because, you know, they don't have
any kids of their own..

174
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,520
and this door was like a child to them.

175
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,840
Well, I'm gonna have to put on a
new lock. They'll find out anyway.

176
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,040
It's looking like an all-day job.
I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,600
Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga class today?

178
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,960
Sure.

179
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,960
-Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
-So it's noticeable, huh?

180
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,960
-Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
-Didn't you two already talk?

181
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah, but..

182
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
Okay. Look, you guys know
that Rachel and I slept together..

183
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,000
but there's something else.

184
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
Rachel's pregnant.

185
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
-Holy mother of God!
-Oh, my God, I can't believe that!

186
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,600
-With my child.
-That is brand-new information!

187
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,760
-You already know, don't you?
-Little bit.

188
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,120
-How you doing?
-Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

189
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,680
It's just, I don't think
I handled it very well.

190
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,080
-What'd you say to her?
-Nothing.

191
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,240
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

192
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,600
-Then when I turned around, she was gone.
-Oh, Ross.

193
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,360
I know. But in my defense, I just found out
that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.

194
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,200
-What?
-I gotta go find her.

195
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?

196
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
So, like, 3 percent of the time,
they don't even work?

197
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
They should put that on the box!

198
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,080
-Evidently, they do.
-What?!

199
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, I'll be.

200
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,280
-I can't believe we're here.
-You've gotta be kidding.

201
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
What?

202
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,560
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the honeymoon suite.

203
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,760
No! You have been screwing us all day!

204
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,200
-Who are you?
-We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

205
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,520
You already got the first-class tickets,
the lounge. We should get free stuff too!

206
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,160
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

207
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,920
You can have the suite if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.

208
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,400
We're here to celebrate our love
for each other.

209
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,240
We don't have to get free stuff.
We just want to be together.

210
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
We need the stuff.

211
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,640
Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I smell gas
coming from your apartment.

212
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,320
-What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
-What else is new?

213
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,520
-We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
-Well, do something. Get in there!

214
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,960
-How? I guess I could break down your door.
-Yeah, do that.

215
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,240
-And you won't blame us for any damage?
-No.

216
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,640
-Are you doing it? I don't hear anything.
-Okay, I'll break it down.

217
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Hi. He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

218
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,360
Okay, we're in.

219
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,800
-Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
-If I said I was, would you judge me?

220
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,480
The doctor'll be here in a minute
to do your sonogram.

221
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
Okay.

222
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,360
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these
at Pottery Barn..

223
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,200
-Hi.
-Hi.

224
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,840
We need to talk.

225
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,680
Right now? Because I kind of got
an alfresco situation going on over here.

226
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Please, I really.. I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier today.

227
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,920
-That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
-What? Oh, yeah, sorry.

228
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,560
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you..

229
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
-Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!
-Right.

230
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,440
I want you to know that I'm gonna be there
through this whole thing. Okay?

231
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,560
The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze
classes, baby-proofing the apartment.

232
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,240
Although, we can worry about that
after we get married.

233
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
-Married?
-Well, yeah, I think we should get married.

234
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,960
Because that's your answer to everything?

235
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,720
No. Because that's the right thing to do.

236
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,280
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But Ross, we are not in love, are we?

237
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,840
No. But still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

238
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,520
Excuse me?

239
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,960
-You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
-What?

240
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,880
If you can't eat by yourself, how do you
expect to have a baby by yourself?

241
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,480
-I can too eat by myself!
-When have you ever?

242
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,120
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

243
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,640
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup!

244
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, please. You inhale your food.

245
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,040
I grew up with Monica.
If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

246
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Am I interrupting?

247
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,200
No, Dr. Long. Please come in.
This is Ross. He is the father.

248
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,760
But not the husband, because,
evidently, she can do this alone.

249
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,920
Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.

250
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,800
-Why you can't admit you need me?
-I need you to stay near my head!

251
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,520
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

252
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Here's your uterus..

253
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,520
and right here is your baby.

254
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh, my God.

255
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,120
There it is. I see it.

256
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

257
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,920
-Okay.
-Thank you.

258
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,160
Pretty amazing, huh?

259
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,720
I don't see it!

260
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,320
-What?
-I can't see it.

261
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,720
But you just said that you did.

262
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,320
I know. I lied. I didn't want her
to think I was a terrible mother.

263
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,200
I can't even see my own baby!

264
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,160
Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

265
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,720
Oh, it's beautiful.

266
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,480
I see it now.

267
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,880
-Do you really?
-No, I don't see it!

268
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,000
Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.

269
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,400
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

270
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah.

271
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,680
Sweetie, that's it.

272
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
That's it?

273
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,440
Well, I saw that.

274
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,560
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

275
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,160
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

276
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
Yeah, that's our baby.

277
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,440
Well, they put up the new door.

278
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,560
-So it's all locked up and secure?
-Yeah. Why?

279
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,000
I was trying to figure out how bad
I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.

280
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
-Hi.
-Hey.

281
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,480
-So how was the doctor?
-Everything went great.

282
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,000
-Good.
-Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

283
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

284
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right..

285
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,960
Ross, I lost it again.

286
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,117
No problem getting
a cab. No traffic.

287
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:08,319
My way totally works. I feel
totally relaxed and calm.

288
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,417
Go, go, go!

289
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,789
Let's see, you're on
the flight to Nassau.

290
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,701
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J.
Mrs. Bing, you'll be in 25K.

291
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,898
- Mrs. Bing.
- It is a funny name.

292
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:28,401
We just got married. We're
going on our honeymoon.

293
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,108
Really? Congratulations.

294
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,845
You know what, let
me see what I can do.

295
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,584
There was a cancellation.
I can bump you into first class.

296
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,885
Thanks.

297
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,894
See, if we've gotten here earlier, those
seats might not have been available.

298
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,930
Compromise works.

299
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:51,196
My name is "Mrs. Bing".
Haven't I compromised enough?

300
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,373
Could you hurry up?

301
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,971
I have never set one of these
off, and I won't start now.

302
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,215
My anklet. That was a close one.

303
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:19,122
Hehe, look at that. Federal law prohibits any
joking regarding aircraft highjacking or boing.

304
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:23,190
Don't worry about me, I take
my bombs very seriously.

305
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:27,068
Sir, come with us.
No, wait! Chandler!

306
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,471
That doesn't count.
Backwards doesn't count!

307
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,414
This is ridiculous.
I was just making a joke.

308
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:45,150
I know the sign says, "No jokes about bombs",
but shouldn't the sign really say,"No Bombs"?

309
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,843
Isn't that the guy we really
have to worry about here?

310
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:50,924
The guy with the bombs? Not the
guy who jokes about his bombs?

311
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,227
Not that I have bombs, but if I did,
I probably wouldn't joke about them.

312
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,200
I'd probably keep
that rather quiet.

313
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,137
I'm sorry, you had
some questions for me?

314
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,071
Miss, what is your
association with this man?

315
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,302
- He's my husband.
- I see.

316
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh, but only for a few days. I don't
know what he does outside of the house.

317
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,079
Thanks, darling.

318
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,588
You see, this is the first time we're traveling my
way, so it's very important we make this flight.

319
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,523
It's her plan versus my plan.

320
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,925
What do you mean by "plan"?

321
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:28,261
You really should just ask
me yes or no questions.

322
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,665
That's not his bag, it's mine.

323
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:35,502
It's just procedure. But
everything is packed perfectly.

324
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:41,535
It took me forever to do this.
There's like over 50 folded pieces.

325
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,080
You're mean.

326
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,116
- All right, you're free to go.
- Thanks.

327
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:54,090
About those speedos, I don't
know how they got in there.

328
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,630
Phoebe and I smell gas
coming from your apartment.

329
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,192
Are you serious?

330
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,036
Joey smells gas. What else is new?

331
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,907
- We'd check it, but you took
our keys. - Do something!

332
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,004
- You want us to break
down your door? - Yes!

333
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,744
- You won't blame us
for any damage? - No!

334
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,787
You sure you want this?

335
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,984
No, I want you to just wait
for the place to blow up.

336
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,753
Step back inside, please.
