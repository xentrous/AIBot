1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,267
Come on, no peeking.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:11,376
Our eyes are closed, and we're
crossing the street. Very good.

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,406
Okay. Open up!

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,411
What do you want to show us?

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,588
Because all I can see
is this bitchen van!

6
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,250
It's for our catering business.

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,757
I think I know that girl.

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,596
We won't keep it this way, though.

9
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,868
We'll replace the sword
with a baguette.

10
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,639
Oh, my God, I think I lost
my virginity in that van.

11
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,641
Also, we don't know
what to do with this.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,644
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.

13
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,913
The One Where
They're Going To Party!

14
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,292
Remember that guy from cooking school
that put cilantro in everything?

15
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,333
Sure, Cilantro Larry!

16
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:49,468
I'm filling in for him as
food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.

17
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,077
What an amazing opportunity
to influence...

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,271
...dozens of people!

19
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,146
What about our catering business?

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,081
It's just one night a week.

21
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,950
Plus, I get to take you out
for free dinners.

22
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,927
Well, in that case...

23
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,928
That was me, hopping on board.

24
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,632
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross!

25
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,497
Quick question for you.

26
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,639
Are you ready to party?

27
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,206
I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

28
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,879
There's this thing about bees
on the Discovery Channel.

29
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,713
I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready...

30
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,214
...to party?

31
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,216
No.

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,817
Gandalf?
Gandalf is coming to town?

33
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:44,655
I have nothing to do, so tomorrow
we are partying with Gandalf, dude!

34
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,632
Dude, we are so going to party!

35
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,669
Wow, okay. Dude alert!

36
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,106
Who is this guy?

37
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,608
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only the funnest guy in the world.

38
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,871
I'll call to get off work tomorrow.

39
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,013
I'll call after you!

40
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,786
This will be so cool!
We never party anymore.

41
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,158
Were you smoking something
in the back of our van?

42
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,421
"We never have fun anymore"?
You have fun with me.

43
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,795
Remember those strippers?
And you paid me $50 to eat that book?

44
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:29,034
You are going to love this guy.
Gandalf is the party wizard.

45
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,073
Why do you call him "Gandalf"?

46
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,967
Gandalf the Wizard.

47
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,717
Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?

48
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,384
No, I had sex in high school.

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,458
Joanna? I was wondering if
I could ask you something.

50
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,758
There's an opening for
a buyer in Junior Miss

51
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,165
-That'd be a step down for me.
-Actually, I meant for me.

52
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,831
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and...

53
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,041
I guess you can't stay
my assistant forever.

54
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,444
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

55
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:16,546
I'm so glad you don't have a problem.
If you did, I wouldn't apply.

56
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,745
In that case

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,117
That's why I'm glad
there's no problem.

58
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,755
I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

59
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,397
That's great!

60
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,124
Junior Miss is where I started.

61
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,395
I slept with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

62
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,006
-Really?
-No.

63
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,110
Yeah.

64
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,344
I mean, no.

65
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,250
With your qualifications, you won't
need to sleep with some guy.

66
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,317
Although I might need
some convincing.

67
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,686
Kidding!

68
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,190
God, I feel wild today!

69
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,429
Man, I am so excited,
I may vomit.

70
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,636
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

71
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,170
You don't understand.
He's amazing.

72
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,348
You never know what'll happen.

73
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,781
You go out for beer
and end up on a boat to Nova Scotia.

74
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,716
-Really?
-It's beautiful country up there.

75
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,188
Hey. Okay.

76
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,726
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

77
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,025
It won't be exactly like last time.

78
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,460
I'll see you guys.

79
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,839
I have an audition,
but I'll meet you.

80
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,839
Where will you be around noon?

81
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,979
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

82
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,642
Hello.

83
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,049
It's Gandalf!

84
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,415
So are you in town?

85
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,562
Oh, well...

86
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,199
Maybe next time, then.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,989
What happened?

88
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,261
He can't come.
He's stuck in Chicago.

89
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,698
Oh, man!

90
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,567
Chicago's so lucky.

91
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,942
Stupid, useless...

92
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,407
...Canadian money!

93
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,685
You have a very impressive resume,
Miss Greene.

94
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:33,188
I especially like what I see about
implementing a new filing system.

95
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,325
Thank you.

96
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,024
Filing system? Those colored labels
you put on all the folders?

97
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,666
It did brighten up
the filing cabinets.

98
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,830
They did more than that.

99
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,104
I notice you've been entrusted with
a lot of important responsibilities.

100
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,679
Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

101
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,951
Rachel has been incredible
at getting my bagels.

102
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,847
She gets it right almost every time.

103
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,359
Of course, I have more
responsibilities than that.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,391
Of course!
There's the coffee too.

105
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,053
Rachel can carry two things at once.

106
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,601
That's very good.

107
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,462
Now a big part of this job is...

108
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,903
...cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,578
-Yes, I
-She shouldn't have any problem.

110
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,237
Her only problem might be getting
too friendly, you know?

111
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,380
I love working with designers.

112
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,555
With them. Under them.
What's the difference?

113
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,563
My first review is out.

114
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,065
The Chelsea Reporter.

115
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,895
These used to keep me so warm.

116
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,602
Look, I'm on the back page.

117
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,304
"Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, I'd get two meals.

118
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,138
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

119
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,249
You really laid into this place.

120
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,443
They don't pay me a penny
a word to make friends.

121
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,021
I found a guy who'd fix up
the van for catering.

122
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,249
You want me to go?

123
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,622
It's okay. Are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

124
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:23,531
Because it would be silly to take it out
if we're just gonna put it back in again.

125
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,498
Haven't we made this decision?

126
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,032
Yeah, all right.

127
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,041
-Who is it?
-It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.

128
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,550
-Oh, my God.
-I want to talk to you about your review.

129
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,589
Call me on the phone.

130
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,859
What? So you can hang up on me?

131
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,029
I'll never let you up,
so just go away.

132
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,567
-Just give me a chance to
-Do you need to get in?

133
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,261
No, Phoebe!

134
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,905
Hey, Monica!

135
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,750
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill."

136
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,941
I couldn't eat it.

137
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,544
My five friends couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

138
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,119
Our service isn't
"grossly incompetent."

139
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,419
The waiter carried
the breadsticks in his pants.

140
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,428
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

141
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,068
...which we do not!

142
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,870
All right, that I'll retract.

143
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,304
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

144
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,903
Your marinara sauce tastes
like tomato juice.

145
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,581
You should serve it
with vodka and celery.

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

147
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,850
You own an Italian restaurant,
and you think that tastes good?

148
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,315
Where are you from?

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,322
Lebanon.

150
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,694
Hand me those tomatoes.

151
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,366
I'll show you
what it should taste like.

152
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,900
How long will this take?
I got another critic to yell at.

153
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,971
Joanna, I want to talk
about that interview.

154
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,446
I thought it went very well.

155
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:23,312
No, it didn't. That's what
I want to talk to you about.

156
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,424
Now just to brief you...

157
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,351
...I may cry.

158
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,764
But they are not
tears of sadness or of anger...

159
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,435
...but just of us having
this discussion.

160
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,269
Please, don't make a scene.

161
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,101
There's nobody here.

162
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,278
Sophie, get in here.

163
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,776
See? You're making
Sophie uncomfortable.

164
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,874
No, she's not.

165
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:57,146
Congratulations. You crossed the line
into completely useless. Get out.

166
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,223
Do you want me to quit?

167
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,826
What makes you think that?

168
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,195
Those things you said
in the interview...

169
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,526
...if you believe them,
I must not be a good assistant.

170
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,798
You know what?

171
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,741
I am just going to pack up my desk...

172
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,879
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

173
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,986
There's no use staying
till the end of the day.

174
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,720
Wait, wait.

175
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,857
You can put
your sad little muffin back.

176
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,131
If you must know the truth, I didn't
want to lose a good assistant.

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,689
What?

178
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,497
That's why I said those things
about your flirting and drinking.

179
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,368
My drinking?

180
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,404
I must have said that
after you left.

181
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,077
Said what, exactly?

182
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,942
You enjoy the occasional drink...

183
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,581
...-ing binge.

184
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,877
Oh, my God!
That is it. I'm leaving!

185
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,022
You are just a horrible person!

186
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,417
Wait, wait.

187
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,526
If you're going to get
all sensitive about it.

188
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,060
I don't want to lose you.

189
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,857
What if I create a position for you?

190
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,034
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

191
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,372
Say more things like that.

192
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,767
Your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

193
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,012
-I need an expense account.
-Done!

194
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,048
-And an assistant.
-Sophie!

195
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,082
Hey, I thought you'd be
out partying with Gandol-...

196
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,317
...-dorf.

197
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,789
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

198
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,897
You've been sitting here all day?

199
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,494
I balanced my checkbook.

200
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,904
And I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

201
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,237
I can't believe he didn't come.

202
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,608
So what? We can still go out
and party ourselves.

203
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,148
With Gandalf, we'd be out all night.

204
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,920
We'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

205
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,524
We could do that.

206
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,158
There was other stuff too.

207
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,927
We'll do it all and better!

208
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,102
After tonight, Gandalf will want
to party with us, dude!

209
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,107
It's not like we don't
know how to party!

210
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,606
All right! Let's go.

211
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,644
Maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

212
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,971
All right!

213
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,218
When were we on a boat?

214
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,183
Remember that cold morning
with those dogs licking your face?

215
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,018
Those were seals, man.

216
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,793
How would this suit
look on an assistant buyer

217
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,062
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me.

218
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,830
But I made him sauce, and he
offered me the job as head chef!

219
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,874
You just ruined the thing
I was practicing, but I'm so happy!

220
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,512
Can you believe it?
I get to run my own kitchen!

221
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,549
Oh, you've waited so long.

222
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,549
Pheebs! Quick question for you.

223
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,724
How would this suit look...

224
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,393
...on an assistant buyer
at Bloomingdale's?

225
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,054
It would totally depend
on her coloring and...

226
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,095
You got the job!

227
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,233
You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

228
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,502
It'll be so great!
I'll help decide what we sell.

229
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,271
I'll have an office
with walls and everything.

230
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,276
I'm going to have walls!

231
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,882
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

232
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,178
The wedding reception.

233
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,589
I kind of need to
talk to you about that.

234
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,895
I think it's time for me to take
a step back from the catering.

235
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,967
But we've only had one job.

236
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,703
But now we have this second one,
and it feels like it's snowballing.

237
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,410
What are you saying?

238
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,915
I got offered the head chef job
at Allesandro's.

239
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,485
It's okay, because
you don't really need me.

240
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,250
You're the cook!

241
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,383
Without you, it's just me
driving up to people's houses...

242
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,460
...with empty trays,
asking for money.

243
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,170
All right. But I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

244
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,566
-And you can keep the van!
-For what?

245
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,768
I can't believe this!

246
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,511
I got to get out of here.

247
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,246
Phoebe, wait a minute.

248
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,847
I'm an assistant buyer!

249
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,256
We'll get coffee, get energized,
then head back out.

250
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,225
-Yeah, all right.
-Okay.

251
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,795
So we're having fun, right?

252
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,127
We don't need that wizard guy.

253
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,364
We hit some clubs,
talk to some strangers...

254
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,100
...then go down to the docks
and see about that boat thing.

255
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,608
I'm kind of beat.

256
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,875
Actually...

257
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,780
...me too.

258
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,877
Are you serious?

259
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,351
Thank God! I'm exhausted.

260
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,986
You guys want coffees?

261
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,391
I don't want to be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

262
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,131
Yeah, me too.

263
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,934
Actually, could I get
some hot water with lemon?

264
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,832
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

265
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,073
I can't hear a word.
My ears are ringing so bad.

266
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,782
I was glad I had
that extra pair of socks.

267
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,348
I used them as mittens.

268
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,543
I didn't want to touch a thing
in that last place.

269
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,423
How sad are we?

270
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,391
Yeah, I know.

271
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,361
You know what?
We're not sad.

272
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,590
We're just not 21 anymore.
You know?

273
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,392
I'm 29 years old, damn it!

274
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,197
I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, watch TV...

275
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,202
...and go to sleep
at a reasonable hour.

276
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,573
I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

277
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,614
And so what if I like to go home,
put on Kenny G and take a bath?

278
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,085
We're 29.
We're not women.

279
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,364
There you are.

280
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,863
I'm glad you decided to hear me out.

281
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,762
Okay, I'm hearing.

282
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,202
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

283
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,479
I came up with a bunch of businesses
that you can do with your van.

284
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,484
You could be
a flower delivery person.

285
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,087
-What?
-Or a bakery delivery person?

286
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,392
Pizza?

287
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,923
I got a whole bunch
of stuff in this area.

288
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,929
But I get the feeling
you don't want to deliver.

289
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,368
-No.
-Okay.

290
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,599
I guess if you
don't want to deliver...

291
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,676
...you probably don't want
to pick up stuff either.

292
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,709
No.

293
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,815
You know what?

294
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,944
Let's do the catering business.

295
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,990
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yeah, I made a commitment to you.

296
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,991
It'd be fun.

297
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,025
It will be fun!

298
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,200
Let's plan the wedding reception.

299
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,474
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

300
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,149
You know what?
I want you to take the chef job.

301
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,152
-Really?
-Yeah.

302
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,380
That's what you really want.

303
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,719
I don't want to be the reason
you're unhappy. I'd be unhappy.

304
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,056
And I really don't want to be
the reason I'm unhappy.

305
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,997
Thank you.

306
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,397
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

307
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,475
Hi, Mrs. Lynch.

308
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,208
Is Joanna in already?

309
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,079
Oh, my goodness!
You haven't heard.

310
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,983
-Heard what?
-Joanna...

311
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,087
...passed away last night.

312
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,995
Oh, my God! How?

313
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,030
She was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

314
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,030
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it!

315
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,668
I know.

316
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,967
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

317
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,039
Oh, God.

318
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,105
I didn't realize
that you were so close.

319
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,181
Yes. So close!

320
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,918
I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

321
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,293
But by any chance, did Joanna...

322
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,430
...send any paperwork
your way before...

323
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,068
-...it happened?
-No, nothing.

324
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:43,408
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off
that curb a few seconds later.

325
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,201
Yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

326
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,437
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

327
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,646
I'm sorry. I have to go.

328
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,042
Good morning!

329
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,284
I guess you didn't
hear about Joanna.

330
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,024
I sure did!

331
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,490
I'm excited about having
Monica on board with us.

332
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,499
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

333
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,367
It is like losing
a member of the family.

334
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,736
Of course, that literally
is the case for several of you.

335
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,043
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

336
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,277
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

337
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,786
I know Monica has a lot
of great ideas for this place.

338
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,053
Well, you all read the review.

339
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,629
So without much further ado...

340
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,791
...I present to you
our new head chef.

341
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:55,638
I just want to say that
with a pinch of excitement...

342
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,213
...a dash of hard work
and a dollop of cooperation...

343
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,386
...we can have the recipe...

344
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,018
Are you going to kill me?
