1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,666
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,674
All right.

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,904
Damn fridge!

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,978
-Hi, Joey. How you doing?
-Great...

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,210
roomie.

6
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,088
-I guess we are roommates.
-I know.

7
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,624
Now that you bring it up,
our fridge is broken.

8
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,159
We need a new one.

9
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,924
I checked and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

10
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,370
I'm not paying for that.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,095
I'm just here while they fix my place.

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,936
Look, Rach, my parents bought this
fridge just after I was born. Okay?

13
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,672
I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

14
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,777
What does that tell you?

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,581
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,294
You know the ATM
only lets you take out 300, so...

17
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,329
I'll take a check for the rest.

18
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,023
You're joking, right?

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,571
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.

20
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,571
Thank God, you're pretty.

21
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,206
The One With Joey's Fridge

22
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,220
Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys?

23
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,391
Of course.
My good friend Joey over here.

24
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,958
I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

25
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,264
There's a charity ball
and Ralph Lauren has a table...

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,596
so I have to go.

27
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,932
-What charity?
-I don't know.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,633
Something, either trees or disease...

29
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,903
Ralph mumbles a lot.

30
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,975
-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
-Yeah. It's weird.

31
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,150
But I need to find a date.

32
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,879
What kind of date?

33
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,924
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

34
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,994
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

35
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,126
So close.

36
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,531
-Hey, everybody!
-Hi, there.

37
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,396
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi, Elizabeth.

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,468
I'm the student.

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,236
Isn't she cute? Nope.

40
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,239
Weren't you guys supposed to...

41
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,507
not be seen together?

42
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,773
We aren't.

43
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:10,046
We just happen
to have run into each other here.

44
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,746
This is...

45
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,661
Oh, sly!

46
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,123
I wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

47
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,765
-See you later?
-Okay.

48
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,730
-Bye, Ross.
-Bye. See you.

49
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,071
-Didn't mean to run into you, sir.
-That's quite all right, ma'am.

50
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,672
Bye.

51
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:33,010
Why is she leaving? Is it a
school night and she has homework?

52
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,574
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

53
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,446
Tell her good luck with that.

54
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,346
Anyone else? Bring them on.

55
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,217
-When's her birthday?
-I don't know. Why?

56
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,623
It's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

57
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,493
-I like Elizabeth.
-Well, thanks.

58
00:03:55,702 --> 00:04:00,196
I like her so much, tell her
I want my cookies early this year.

59
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,043
A box of Thin Mints
and some Tagalongs.

60
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,838
Give him a break.
Ross, how's it going with her?

61
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,412
It's been great.

62
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,619
She's 20, so she's not too serious,
which is perfect for me now.

63
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,822
That's great.
Seriously, she seems nice.

64
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,958
I know you guys like
to give me a hard time...

65
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,718
but it means a lot to me.

66
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,762
-Just knowing..
-Okay, I got a good one.

67
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,627
What is she, like, 12?

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,710
Chandler, do we talk about
our relationship enough?

69
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,651
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?

70
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,082
Okay.

71
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,123
I thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.

72
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,294
That's so funny.
We found someone too.

73
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,429
Good. She'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,958
-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
-Because that's just your taste.

75
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,264
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

76
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,498
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

77
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,702
My guy is a lawyer,
who does volunteer work.

78
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,312
And he has one of these.

79
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,950
A face ass?

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,616
A chin dimple.

81
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,045
Well, you know, our guy works
with Chandler.

82
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,316
He's really nice and smart,
and he's a great dresser.

83
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,789
-Have you seen your guy's body?
-No. Our guy's just a floating head.

84
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,631
Well, my guy is spectacular.
He's a massage client.

85
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,568
And one time, when he was on the
table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.

86
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,102
-You're not supposed to look.
-Like there are police for that.

87
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,509
You look? You massaged me.

88
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,512
I know.

89
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,520
Fine. Your guy may have a great body,
but our guy is really funny.

90
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,816
Chandler funny?

91
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,689
-Our guy's a great dancer.
-My guy's well-read.

92
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,191
-Our guy has great hair.
-My guy has great teeth.

93
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,762
Our guy smells incredible.

94
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,036
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

95
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,442
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

96
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,877
The fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,284
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

98
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,419
What was in that brown jar?

99
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,925
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,026
So anyway, how do you want to pay me?

101
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,233
Is this a service you're providing me?

102
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,473
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.

103
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,209
Our new fridge?

104
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,777
-I don't live here anymore.
-So what?

105
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,381
Look, okay, suppose we were
a divorced couple.

106
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,375
And I got custody of the kid. Right?

107
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,613
Now suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

108
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,361
Okay.

109
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,487
Give me $400!

110
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,326
Thank God, you're pretty.

111
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,810
Professor Geller?

112
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,403
Oh, a student I don't know.

113
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,543
I was wondering if I
could talk to you for a moment?

114
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,244
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

115
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,981
Making out in your office.

116
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,721
Of course. Why don't we go inside.

117
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,830
-What?
-Doorknob.

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,473
Sorry.

119
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,370
I actually do need to talk to you.

120
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,567
What about?

121
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,211
-Spring vacation?
-Spring vacation?

122
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,780
Yeah, we have time off, and
a lot of people are going on trips..

123
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,044
-Professor Geller.
-Yes, Professor Friesenstinlender.

124
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,285
I'll be with you in one moment.

125
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,361
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.

126
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:26,704
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

127
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,568
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this.

128
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,006
-What do I tell her?
-Tell her the truth, tell her you're not ready.

129
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,847
I could do that.

130
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,782
-What if she gets upset?
-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

131
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,251
Or you could just, you know, you...

132
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,859
What the hell are you doing?

133
00:08:55,935 --> 00:09:00,372
What the hell am I doing?
You just broke my fridge!

134
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,601
What? How do..?

135
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,776
How do you know it's even broken?

136
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,508
You think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

137
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,775
Excuse me!

138
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,514
Well, what do you know?

139
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,981
Broken!

140
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,720
That'll be $400.

141
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,858
Joey, I saw you push him.

142
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,861
You pushed him.

143
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,794
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

144
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,339
Remember I told you about our fridge?

145
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,979
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

146
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,239
Do not give him any money!

147
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,283
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!

148
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,295
-You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
-Yes. Please come in.

149
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,171
-Doorknob?
-Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

150
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,772
I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

151
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,343
Good.

152
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,972
Look, I...

153
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,181
Look, I'm having
a great time with you.

154
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,692
And I just don't want us to move too
fast or put too much pressure on us.

155
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,154
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

156
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,765
It's too soon.

157
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,428
Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

158
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:44,739
I just wanted to tell you that I'm
going to Florida for a couple weeks.

159
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,473
No.

160
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,379
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

161
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,514
What I meant was..

162
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,018
You are so adorable.

163
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,192
That. Let's talk about that.

164
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,060
-Hi.
-Hi.

165
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,891
How did it go with Elizabeth?

166
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,465
Fine. Just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

167
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,266
She just wanted to let me know
she's going to Florida for a spring vacation.

168
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,739
Wait a minute. Is she going
for spring vacation or spring break? Wahoo!

169
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,707
What's the difference?

170
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,143
Spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

171
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,014
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

172
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,817
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

173
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,018
-What did you do on yours?
-I went to Egypt with my dad.

174
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,526
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo!"

175
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,137
I think Elizabeth is a little more
serious than: "Spring break, wahoo!"

176
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,869
Come on, she's taking my class.

177
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,343
-And slept with the professor.
-I'm gonna call her.

178
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,011
You guys,
I want you to meet Sebastian.

179
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:08,288
We met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream.

180
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,959
What? I read that.

181
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,626
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-Yes. Thank you.

182
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,467
-Rachel, what the hell is this?
-What?

183
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,575
You ask us to find a guy, and you come
traipsing in here with a guy of your own?

184
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,867
You found me a guy?

185
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,708
Yes. We found you a really cute,
funny guy from Chandler's work.

186
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,317
Yeah, and I found you one too,
who is not a weirdo.

187
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,349
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

188
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,287
but I'm gonna take Sebastian.

189
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,395
Are you sure?
Our guy smells incredible.

190
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,031
Would you stop it with that already?

191
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,127
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

192
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,333
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

193
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,832
-Not really. Why?
-No reason.

194
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,307
I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

195
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,978
Are you funny?

196
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,750
-Excuse me?
-What are you guys doing?

197
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,314
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

198
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,121
I just wanted to have coffee
with Rachel.

199
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,589
Well, so do a lot of people.

200
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,520
-Actually, I gotta get going.
-But you..

201
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,124
-Give me a call sometime.
-You didn't give me your phone number.

202
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,996
Okay, see you later.

203
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,531
Turns out he is kind of funny.

204
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,700
I cannot believe you guys!

205
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,938
He was really nice,
and he just left because of you!

206
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,180
Yeah, but "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

207
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,216
You know what I noticed, Rachel?
He scares easy.

208
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,721
Is that the kind of guy you wanna take
to a ball?

209
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,894
"Hey, Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

210
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,885
"Okay. I gotta go."

211
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,763
Stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

212
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,629
That is a very
insensitive thing to do.

213
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,135
Let us make it up to you.
We have two really great guys for you.

214
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,097
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

215
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:08,246
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

216
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,309
-All right.
-So you will meet our guys?

217
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,541
Yes.

218
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,612
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

219
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,789
Our guy is perfect.

220
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:23,127
Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough for herself.

221
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,127
There you are!
You broke my fridge.

222
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,799
You owe me $400.

223
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,269
-Okay, sure.
-Really?

224
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,673
Technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

225
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,845
on your last 10 auditions.

226
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,880
Call it even?

227
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,313
Okay.

228
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,717
There you are.

229
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,424
What did Elizabeth say?

230
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,124
Turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, wahoo."

231
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,097
That means wet T-shirt contests, guys
doing shots off of girls' bodies...

232
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,394
waking up with strangers.

233
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,935
She is gonna have a great time!

234
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,306
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

235
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,879
-You know the hotels?
-I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!

236
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,777
In 1981, you were 13.

237
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,253
So? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
Had a blast.

238
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:26,356
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

239
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,485
Okay, she can't go.

240
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,926
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

241
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,158
-What am I supposed to do?
-You just have to be cool with it.

242
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,236
What if she goes down there and sleeps
with a bunch of guys?

243
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,164
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

244
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,682
I'm sorry, this is very serious.
And you know what, Ross?

245
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,683
You like her, she likes you,
everything's gonna be fine.

246
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,253
You're right.
I'm probably overreacting.

247
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,119
It's just she's staying at this party hotel
on the beach...

248
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,817
with a huge pool and free drinks
with every meal.

249
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,523
If she's got enough money for that, she
can certainly pat for the fridge she broke.

250
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,597
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

251
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,710
I've been working
so hard this semester.

252
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,403
I really need to go crazy,
blow off some steam.

253
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,411
Sure.

254
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,944
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet, but...

255
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,355
I know a great way
to blow off steam.

256
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,426
-What?
-Are you into crafts at all?

257
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,592
Ross, are you okay?

258
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,896
Yeah. Of course I'm okay.

259
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,126
I'm just being supportive.

260
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,203
Supportive of you
and this whole trip...

261
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,273
and what's this?

262
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,743
It's a bathing suit?

263
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,079
To wear in front of people?

264
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,645
Is that supportive?

265
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,115
Is this?

266
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,316
Okay, good.

267
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,479
-Hey.
-Hi.

268
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,650
We're so glad you decided to
meet our guy. You'll like him so much.

269
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,693
-When do you want to meet him?
-I don't know.

270
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,765
-I don't work late tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night is good.

271
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:20,564
But why put off something till
tomorrow that you could do it right now?

272
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,071
-Eldad, come here!
-What?

273
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,940
-This is Rachel.
-How are you?

274
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,579
A little blindsided but good.

275
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,510
Eldad, sit down. Move over now.

276
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,512
There you go. There you are.

277
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,286
Okay, we can take a hint!

278
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,389
What? What are you doing here?

279
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,788
This is Patrick.

280
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,951
-Hi.
-Hi.

281
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,724
You're too late because
she's already with our guy.

282
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:52,302
You're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

283
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,598
Come on.

284
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,842
Rachel? This is Patrick.

285
00:17:58,944 --> 00:17:59,968
-Hi.
-Hi.

286
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,010
This is the guy I was telling you about.

287
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,150
This suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

288
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,447
Okay.

289
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,723
But, Phoebe, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

290
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,517
Okay. That's okay. Have a seat.

291
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,621
-You can't do that!
-I should go.

292
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,856
Sit down, we're winning.

293
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,658
Maybe I should go.

294
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,803
No. Have a seat!

295
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,700
Rachel, you haven't touched
Eldad's hair.

296
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,974
-He has the softest hair. Touch it.
-I'm good.

297
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,614
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

298
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,817
This isn't really worth the free massage.

299
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,044
-That's right. Bye-bye.
-No.

300
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,349
Eldad is much more cooperative,
and he can dance.

301
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,150
You dance for Rachel.

302
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,558
Don't dance for me. Please!

303
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,164
What is the matter with you?

304
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,433
Yeah, let's talk it out.

305
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,030
Am I the only one that this is
embarrassing for?

306
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,069
I'm a little embarrassed.

307
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,440
I'll tell you who should
be embarrassed. It's you guys.

308
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,046
I do not need you
to get me a date.

309
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,013
-Why did she ask us to..?
-I am still talking!

310
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,016
Then you chase away
the one guy I actually liked.

311
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,782
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

312
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,016
all the cash.

313
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,354
And you really do have very soft hair.

314
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:30,661
But I'd much rather go to the ball by
myself than go through any more of this.

315
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,097
Goodbye.

316
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,000
Now, do you use some sort of
special conditioner on that hair?

317
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,438
Papaya extract.

318
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,873
Thank you.

319
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,015
So have a great time down there.

320
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,177
-I will.
-Yeah.

321
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,190
-Did you pack that bathing suit?
-Yeah.

322
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,021
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while.

323
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,456
Anyway.

324
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,831
I am worried about that suit.

325
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,006
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

326
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,402
I'm concerned about your health.

327
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,175
Sun exposure.

328
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,676
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.

329
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,610
-It's SPF 30.
-All right.

330
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,842
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually 30.

331
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,420
Sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4 and...

332
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,853
more often than not, it's just milk.

333
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,427
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

334
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,057
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

335
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,426
I really like you.

336
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,062
I like how things are going between us.

337
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,498
-Really?
-Yeah.

338
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,539
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

339
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,676
Okay. Cool.

340
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,572
Here they are!

341
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,656
Call me!

342
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,200
Sorry for pushing those guys on you.

343
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,301
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

344
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:16,702
The charity was a big success, and they
raised a lot of money and awareness.

345
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,741
So, what was it for anyway?

346
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,503
I wanna say a disease.

347
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:30,349
I just got this really weird message
from Ross. He said to turn on MTV.

348
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,961
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!

349
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,070
Professor Geller.

350
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,146
To be 13 again...
