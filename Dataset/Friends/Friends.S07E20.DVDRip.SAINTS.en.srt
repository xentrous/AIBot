1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,970
Out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,012
Probably Monica and Chandler.

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,584
Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?

4
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:22,584
We don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

5
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,290
That'd be great. Thanks.

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,929
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

7
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,701
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?

8
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,299
What's up?!

9
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,298
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,774
What's up with you?

11
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,413
Why don't I tell you over here?

12
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:53,513
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,444
Poor Ray-Ray.

14
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,181
Oh, no. It's all good.

15
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,189
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,228
I will not. I'm the divisional head
of men's sportswear.

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,923
Shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

18
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,535
- Oh, please.
- Are you?

19
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,133
No.

20
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,274
We have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

21
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,004
- Tomorrow. I don't know.
- You're having dinner with me.

22
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,339
Shut up.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,644
I've gotta go.
This has been so great.

24
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,845
Oh, there you are.
You're a bad man for giving me these.

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,117
- So listen, just call me. Here's my card.
- Oh, wow, thanks.

26
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,592
- You're in real estate?
- No, that's an old card.

27
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,857
I got out of that to do something...

28
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,796
...where I could help people
and make a difference.

29
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,493
What do you do now?

30
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,701
I'm a party planner.

31
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,104
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

32
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,137
Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.

33
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,049
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

34
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,015
She seems really, really fun!

35
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,223
She's actually sweet,
and we used to be very close.

36
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,658
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you...?

37
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,332
Who you what? Who you what?

38
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,401
- Yes.
- Wow!

39
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,969
Wow, what? Who you what?

40
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,333
Oh, it's not a big deal.

41
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,667
They were lovers.

42
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,503
- What?
- What?

43
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,508
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

44
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,206
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,046
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

46
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,586
...kissing for a bit.

47
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,984
So that's two of my wives.

48
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,885
Where are you going?

49
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,791
To bring her back here!
Ross, get the sangria!

50
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,560
The One With Rachel's Big Kiss

51
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,528
So this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,234
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

53
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,214
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

54
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,283
...talking to the cute bartender.

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,851
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

56
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,121
The red are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

57
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,128
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

58
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,130
Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

59
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,269
Certainly not a close one.

60
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,567
Hey, Rach.

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,739
Stop picturing it!

62
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,779
I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,686
They all look like they're having fun
don't they?

64
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,621
So where are my parents gonna be?

65
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,090
Well, if this is the wedding hall...

66
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,996
...then your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

67
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,128
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

68
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,740
Why would they think they're invited?

69
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,373
You got me. I don't...

70
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,672
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

71
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,783
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's are coming.

72
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,249
Ross' parents are coming.

73
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,788
Ross' parents are my parents.

74
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,757
Well, see, parents are coming.

75
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,953
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

76
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,564
Well, this is just sad.

77
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,895
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

78
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,438
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

79
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,610
That is not a problem.

80
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,373
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Get out of here!

81
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:24,420
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

82
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:29,117
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

83
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,189
Thanks a lot for hooking me up.

84
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,835
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

85
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,071
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

86
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,106
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

87
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,978
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

88
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:53,549
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

89
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,521
- You mean like for award shows?
- Some of them.

90
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,556
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling:

91
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,953
"Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"

92
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,489
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

93
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,758
...and a little less E!

94
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,228
Okay. Who wore those?

95
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,003
- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

96
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,403
This one is Paul O'Neill.

97
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,013
Who's that?

98
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,711
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

99
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,117
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

100
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,257
- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?

101
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,554
Are you serious?

102
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,753
007?

103
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:44,062
This is James Bond's tux? I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

104
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,897
It's a pretty cool tux.

105
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,870
It's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

106
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,543
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

107
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,380
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

108
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,353
Would Monica let me wear this?

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,751
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

110
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,498
I like our way.

111
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,232
Chess!

112
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,732
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,542
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

114
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,838
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

115
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,609
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

116
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,581
And maybe a hat.

117
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,912
- Does Monica know about this?
- No.

118
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,216
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

119
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,160
You want to go to a movie tonight?

120
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,524
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

121
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,824
Can I come?

122
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,537
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

123
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,530
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

124
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,403
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

125
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,545
- Joey's.
- Okay.

126
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,648
I had this college friend...

127
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,684
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

128
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,254
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.

129
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,486
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

130
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,562
- It did.
- Sure.

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,964
Hey. It happened.

132
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,839
It was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

133
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,339
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

134
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,842
And we ended up kissing.

135
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,343
For several minutes.

136
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,211
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

137
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,844
Why are you taking this away from me?

138
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,751
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

139
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,985
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

140
00:08:55,835 --> 00:09:00,738
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

141
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,303
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're so...

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,409
...vanilla.

143
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:12,377
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

144
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,748
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

145
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,217
To Ross.

146
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,353
If you don't believe me...

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,291
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

148
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,795
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

149
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,501
You should get inside my head.

150
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,008
Guess what I got for your wedding?

151
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,677
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

152
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,575
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

153
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,544
Batman's tux!

154
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,550
- What?
- That's right.

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,487
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

156
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,091
...that Batman film he was in.

157
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,891
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

158
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,655
- James Bond's tux!
- So?

159
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,461
So? If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

160
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,968
You need something
to make this day special?

161
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,573
Hello! You have
the most special thing of all.

162
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,040
You are marrying the woman you love.

163
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,014
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

164
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:24,053
"Pretty please?" Not very 007.

165
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,288
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

166
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,863
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

167
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,900
Okay, good, you're here.
All right, I figured it out.

168
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

169
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,103
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

170
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,212
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

171
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,310
Yeah. They're not coming.

172
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,349
What?

173
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,113
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

174
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,688
They feel unwanted.

175
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,691
That's too bad.
It's true. But too bad.

176
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,226
If you could just call my mom.

177
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,195
Just let her know
you want them there.

178
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,632
This is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

179
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,804
No, she hasn't.

180
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,668
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

181
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,437
What am I gonna say?

182
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:22,080
Tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, blame it on the post office.

183
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,773
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

184
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,779
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

185
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,089
Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani?
This is Monica Geller.

186
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:40,755
I'm just calling to say that we really
hope you can make it to the wedding.

187
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,800
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

188
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,303
I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

189
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,001
Tell me about it!

190
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:57,080
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

191
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,016
What are they, Irish?

192
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,558
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

193
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,321
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

194
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,930
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

195
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,035
Oh, well.

196
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,903
- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- That's great.

197
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,872
- Were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

198
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,380
Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.

199
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,188
What one?

200
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,721
We were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

201
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,360
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

202
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,532
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

203
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,567
Anyway...

204
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,997
Speaking of drinking too much,
I told Phoebe...

205
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,645
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

206
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,478
What?

207
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:07,778
Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
on and the coconut bikini tops.

208
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,150
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

209
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,584
...and we made out.

210
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,996
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

211
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,755
Really?

212
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,631
Ross is Batman.

213
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:34,077
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

214
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,410
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.

215
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,177
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

216
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:46,120
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

217
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:50,260
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

218
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:57,262
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Batman has Robin.

219
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,665
We get ESPN, right?

220
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:11,381
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?

221
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,415
I don't like martinis.

222
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,485
- A Yoo-hoo with a funny straw?
- Yum.

223
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,457
I know the invitation says 6 p. M.

224
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,392
But does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

225
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,997
"The show"?

226
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,436
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

227
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,665
But weddings start
a little late, right?

228
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,476
Have you ever been
to one of my weddings?

229
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,777
Well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

230
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,178
...and I want my parents to see me.

231
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,151
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

232
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,854
The wedding starts at 6.

233
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,390
Okay. I totally hear you.

234
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,256
How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

235
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,323
You'll "vamp"?

236
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,501
Like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

237
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,638
Because in Joey Tribbiani,
you get a minister and an entertainer.

238
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,434
I'm a "ministainer." All right?

239
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,211
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

240
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,181
Oh, please, God. Don't vamp.

241
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,180
Okay, maybe I'll talk to Chandler.

242
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,755
And maybe he'd like to get married
at 007 o'clock.

243
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,491
All right. I will give you
10 extra minutes. That is it.

244
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,594
That's great! Thank you so much.

245
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,164
Well, we're in luck.
The tux fits perfectly.

246
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,173
Chandler, that jacket,
it's way too big.

247
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,936
Oh, that's okay.
The pants are way too small.

248
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,348
I'm sorry, sweetie.
You cannot wear that.

249
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,412
Now this means Ross is gonna be
the only cool one.

250
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,318
Something, by the way,
I never thought I would say.

251
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,961
Dude, take that thing off.
You look like a fool.

252
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,422
Come next door. I got some minister
headdresses I want you to see.

253
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,435
How can you not remember us kissing?

254
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:17,074
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

255
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,480
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

256
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,046
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

257
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,413
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

258
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,518
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

259
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,921
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

260
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,755
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

261
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,263
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

262
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,732
No!

263
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,071
- All right.
- Okay, fine.

264
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,538
You don't have to admit it
because I know that it happened.

265
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,010
Okay!

266
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,306
You have to admit it!
We kissed! Say it!

267
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,684
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

268
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,514
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

269
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,323
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

270
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,385
- But she didn't.
- I know.

271
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,561
You carry that around?

272
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,801
Yes. I find it to be
something of a conversation piece.

273
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,774
- Between you and...?
- Gunther.

274
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,176
Why don't we put them on?

275
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,313
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

276
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,846
I would,
but my pants are a little tight.

277
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,851
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

278
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,114
Well, that stinks.

279
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,520
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

280
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,629
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

281
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,726
Let me try it on.

282
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,804
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

283
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,210
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

284
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,179
What's this?

285
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,081
An invitation to
the At First Sight premiere?

286
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,085
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.

287
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:17,023
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

288
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,023
Let me see that.

289
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,865
Oh, man.

290
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,868
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

291
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,672
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

292
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,776
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

293
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,105
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

294
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:41,216
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

295
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,651
I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

296
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,257
They're so happy
to be a part of your special day.

297
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,390
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

298
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:57,658
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

299
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,468
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

300
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,108
...is for party time.

301
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,409
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

302
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,383
It was great meeting you.

303
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,455
And, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because...

304
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,060
...you know, you've gotten weird.

305
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,065
Take care, you guys.

306
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,597
Wait a minute. Okay, look.

307
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,896
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

308
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,107
I won't let you take it away.

309
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,574
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...

310
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,953
Oh, my God. You love me.

311
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,789
What?

312
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,688
Of course I remember.
I think about it all the time.

313
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,390
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together...

314
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:08,467
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love...

315
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:15,513
Look who's being suddenly shy.

316
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,147
You have to feel what I feel.

317
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,114
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

318
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,481
I'm just a good kisser.

319
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,951
Shut up.

320
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,358
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,697
You don't have to be sorry.

322
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,834
I'm obviously kidding.

323
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,039
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

324
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,539
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

325
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,910
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

326
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,318
Anyway, I gotta go.

327
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,611
A kiss goodbye?

328
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,482
No? Okay.

329
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,564
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...

330
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,774
What the hell was that?

331
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,175
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

332
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,814
- And?
- I've had better.

333
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,024
I found one that fits.

334
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,593
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

335
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,426
Look at you, all handsome.
