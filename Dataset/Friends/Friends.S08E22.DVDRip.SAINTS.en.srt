1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,480
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,560
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,280
Wow! It looks really violent!

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,800
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitable for children!

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,840
-I cannot wait to see this.
-It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,240
-I started that!
-I thought I did!

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,440
I just talked to my agent..

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,440
and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,560
-Will we take a limo?
-Sure!

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,520
I love taking limos
when nobody died.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,800
Well, I won't be able to come.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,120
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,760
You should come.
Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,520
That way for the first few moments of
her life, she'll think we're really fancy.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,080
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,360
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm looking forward
to the next part..

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,520
I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,400
That's right. Still no baby.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,200
What's the matter? Is the puffy,
sweaty pregnant lady..

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,400
disturbing your precious
coffee time?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,200
Come on, people, make some room.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,040
Sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
You.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,280
Like you haven't done enough.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,520
I know you're miserable.
I wish there was something I could do.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,960
I wish I were a sea horse.

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,520
And then also,
I'd be far away in the sea.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,120
God.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,280
I know. I remember toward the end..

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,320
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,960
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,240
Let's.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,560
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,640
-What are you doing here?
-They sent me home from work.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,160
They said, "Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest."

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
You know what? Screw them!

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,120
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,280
Or you could do volunteer work.

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,320
-Hello?
-Joey, it's Estelle.

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,400
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,200
-You told me I could have six tickets.
-I sold four on eBay.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,960
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy 372.

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,680
So that's it? I only get
to bring one guest?

49
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Yeah. What time you
wanna pick me up?

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Hello?

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,000
You hear that? I only get one
extra ticket to my premiere.

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,320
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,320
-What about me?
-You said you didn't want to go.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,360
I don't. But I would
still like to be acknowledged.

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,320
-Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
-Definitely not invisible.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,920
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,840
-You snooze, you lose.
-He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,200
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,520
And, Joey, not that this should affect
you at all, but if you pick me..

60
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,160
I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress cut down to here.

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,760
-I haven't seen this dress.
-Star in a movie.

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,240
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,320
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,400
Well..

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,320
I think I want to take Chandler.

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
-You want to take me?
-Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

68
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,600
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,120
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,920
This will be my way
of paying you back.

71
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,080
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,600
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,720
I don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

74
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,920
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

75
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,040
He read lines with me. He went with me
on auditions when I was nervous.

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,400
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts that I wanted.

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,040
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't.

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,480
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,480
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,880
-I'm gonna go shave.
-Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.

82
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
I have to pee.

83
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,400
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

84
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,920
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just.. out of her.

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,560
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,920
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.

87
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,520
Care to make it interesting?

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,000
-I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
-You're on.

89
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,640
-Okay, how much?
-One hundred thousand dollars.

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,760
-How about 50 bucks?
-I'll call Zurich and move some money.

91
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,320
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,280
No one's here.

93
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,920
Oh, damn it!

94
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,400
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do I look?

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
-A little tall.
-What?

96
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,720
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?

97
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,120
There you go.

98
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,320
It's just so glamorous.

99
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

100
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,480
And you're still pregnant.

101
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.

102
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,600
You know what? You look great.
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

103
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,800
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

104
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,000
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

105
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,200
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

106
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,520
All right, stop it.

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
-Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
-Fine.

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,480
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp.. right there?

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,080
-Rachel here? We have an appointment.
-In the bathroom.

110
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,400
-Rach, we gotta go.
-In a minute!

111
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,600
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
All right, let's go.

113
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Oh, wait a minute.

114
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,240
Do I have to pee again?

115
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
No, I'm good.

116
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,840
Do you want to go change first?

117
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,760
The doctor's staying open late for us,
but if you hurry..

118
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,480
-No, I'm fine.
-You don't think that's inappropriate?

119
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,200
-What?
-Good God, man. Don't anger it.

120
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,360
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am..

121
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

122
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,080
No! Don't call me "Mommy."

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,960
It's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

124
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
I'm actually with her on this one.

125
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,440
Come on, Ross.
We're gonna be late.

126
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
Either of you want to be Ross?

127
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,480
I thought I knew who the enemy was,
but it was you.

128
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,040
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

129
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm fighting for every man
in the 82nd Ground Division.

130
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,760
Ross?
Can I ask you something?

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,840
When Carol was pregnant with Ben..

132
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,920
were you this irritating?

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,400
-Excuse me?
-Nothing. You're just..

134
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,640
You've been a little short with me
lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

135
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,640
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

136
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,240
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

137
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
Okay.

138
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,080
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

139
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows..

140
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,600
how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,920
-Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
-You're nice to her.

142
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,960
She has the drugs.

143
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
We'll do a quick check.

144
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,960
Eight days late, huh?
You must be getting uncomfortable.

145
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah, just a tad.

146
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,280
You're 80% effaced. You're on your way.
It still could last a while.

147
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,400
-There are ways to help things along.
-Do them!

148
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,960
Actually, they're things
that you can do. Home remedies.

149
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,800
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

150
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,400
-Well, we are ready to try anything.
-There's an herbal tea you can drink.

151
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,160
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

152
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
We will do all of those.

153
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,520
-Taking a long walk.
-Good. Done.

154
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,320
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

155
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,400
You've got to be kidding me!

156
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

157
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,360
-You liked it? You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah!

158
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,880
-Well, which part exactly?
-The whole thing! Here we go!

159
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,400
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

160
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

161
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,280
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

162
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,880
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.

163
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,080
You fell asleep!

164
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,200
There was no kangaroo! They didn't
take any of my suggestions!

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,400
-I can't believe you fell asleep.
-I can't believe it either.

166
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,240
Maybe it didn't happen.

167
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,440
Maybe you fell asleep
and dreamt the whole thing.

168
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,640
And this conversation we're having
right now is part of that dream.

169
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,720
Wake up, Joe!

170
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,280
-Thanks for coming. See you later.
-Don't go. I'm so sorry.

171
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,480
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

172
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,400
Or call an ambulance!

173
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,880
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

174
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,360
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

175
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
We tried them all.

176
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,600
We went for a walk, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

177
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,080
There is one thing we didn't try.

178
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,200
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

179
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,080
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today..

180
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,720
I think you should do it.

181
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,400
-It's sex.
-Do it!

182
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
-Monica.
-It's been a really long time for you.

183
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,600
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

184
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,600
Oh, I don't know about that.

185
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,960
I think if the two of you had sex, the
repercussions would be catastrophic.

186
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
All right, let's be practical.

187
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,080
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

188
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,480
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

189
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,480
Okay, okay. Yeah,
I don't think I wanna do that.

190
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,360
You sure? I'm just saying..

191
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,920
the baby's head
isn't getting any smaller.

192
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,720
Monica, what is the matter with you?

193
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,320
-I just want the baby to be born today.
-Why today?

194
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,080
Okay, fine.

195
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,120
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to lose.

196
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

197
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,280
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

198
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,880
-I'll take that bet.
-What?

199
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm miserable. I may as well
make some money out of it.

200
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,320
Can I get some of that action?

201
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,840
I'm betting against all of you?

202
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,880
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

203
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,760
Okay.

204
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,040
Sixty, 80, 100.

205
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,280
And 50.

206
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,400
And two.

207
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Yeah, baby.

208
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,320
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

209
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,560
Where have you been? I want
to talk to you. I still feel bad.

210
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

211
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm so sorry.

212
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,840
The reason I came over is to settle things
between us. You've done a lot for me.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,320
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

214
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,720
-So how much do I owe you?
-What?

215
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,400
-I don't want to owe you anything.
-You don't owe me.

216
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,040
-I don't want your..
-We're doing this!

217
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,000
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

218
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,480
-I don't know, $500.
-Okay, $500. What else?

219
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,280
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.

220
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,400
Okay, so that's another $500.
That's 500 and 500. That's..

221
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,480
-You want a calculator?
-Please.

222
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,320
Here.

223
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,000
All right, what else?

224
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,920
Well, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes..

225
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,920
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

226
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,400
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

227
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,880
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

228
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,040
What the hell are you talking about?
The South will rise again, man.

229
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,240
Yes, money well-spent.

230
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
Okay, what else? Rent.

231
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,200
Two, three years of rent,
utilities, food..

232
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,760
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for..

233
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,520
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

234
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,800
How do you clear this thing?

235
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,680
Finish your enchilada.

236
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,640
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.

237
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,040
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

238
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,160
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

239
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,840
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

240
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,920
I am feeling nothing.

241
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that..

242
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,520
really makes me want
to have sex with you.

243
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,320
-Stop it.
-Come on! Why are we wasting time?

244
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,840
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

245
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

246
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,640
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

247
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,880
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

248
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

249
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Make love? What are you, a girl?

250
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,880
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

251
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

252
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,160
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

253
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,320
I love when you talk dirty to me.

254
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

255
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,960
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

256
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,600
Let me just bend over and get it.

257
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,200
Oh, God!

258
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,440
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

259
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,160
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

260
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,040
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

261
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,400
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

262
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,040
-You know what?
-What?

263
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,240
Forget it.

264
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,280
What now, Ross,
you're not gonna talk?

265
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,040
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

266
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,240
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

267
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,360
You'd think the jalapeno would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

268
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,080
That's not enough..
What are you doing?

269
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
I'm getting that baby out of you!

270
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,280
-Oh, God!
-I know.

271
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh, no, no, no.

272
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,040
I think my water just broke.

273
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I am good!

274
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,480
Okay, I got the pillow.
I got the bag.

275
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,280
-You got the keys?
-I got the keys.

276
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,920
We're having a baby.

277
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,520
I didn't have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time..?

278
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,480
-Not so much.
-Okay, let's go.

279
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
-200.
-Thank you.

280
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,120
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

281
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,440
Okay.

282
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,840
Hello?

283
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,080
I guess we could bet
one more time.

284
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,160
-Is Rachel having the baby?
-How did you know that?

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,080
-Joey! Chandler!
-They're at the coffee house.

286
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,640
You know everything!

287
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,120
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

288
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,880
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.

289
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,640
-We know it's a girl.
-I'll give you really good odds.
