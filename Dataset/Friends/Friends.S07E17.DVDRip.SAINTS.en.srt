1
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:10,626
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to six.

2
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:12,872
Food? Oh, give me.

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,099
Did Monica mention we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

4
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:19,902
You're into swing music?

5
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:23,549
I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,944
- Chandler?
- Gap commercial.

7
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:32,188
- Did you book them? Did you call?
- I will.

8
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:36,553
- You want me to call?
- I'll do it. You stick to your job.

9
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,629
- What is your job?
- Staying out of the way.

10
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:44,464
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15.

11
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:48,138
- There were only 12.
- Oh, yeah, I added three.

12
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:50,808
What are peanut-butter fingers?

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,277
The One With the
Cheap Wedding Dress

14
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,948
Well, hello.

15
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:40,887
She's cute.

16
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,152
Should we go try to talk to her?

17
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:48,366
Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous
talking to pretty girls anymore.

18
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,533
Could you guys help me?

19
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:55,569
Yeah, let me get that for you.

20
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:59,369
- It's really heavy.
- I got it.

21
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:06,884
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend Chandler.

22
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:10,678
I'm Kristen.

23
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,221
Kristen, hi. Are you new to the area?

24
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:16,393
Because if you are, I'd love
to show you around sometime.

25
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:19,928
I actually just moved
from four blocks over.

26
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,565
But this block is like another world.

27
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:26,633
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

28
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:32,003
This street is the first in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

29
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:35,209
Before that, sewage and waste...

30
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:38,541
...would just flow
right down the street.

31
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,310
Sometimes ankle-deep.

32
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:43,912
Smooth.

33
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,354
Excuse me?

34
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:55,126
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner?

35
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,993
- I'd like that.
- Great.

36
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,430
Let me take this up.

37
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,732
- After you.
- Oh, no. After you.

38
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:05,104
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:15,912
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

40
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,456
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

41
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,789
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

42
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:28,790
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

43
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:31,161
I can't believe I found it.

44
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:35,874
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

45
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,336
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.

46
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,876
I'm Megan Bailey.

47
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:44,572
- Have you found your dress?
- These dresses are amazing...

48
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,252
...but I couldn't afford one.
- I can't either.

49
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,117
I'm here to figure out which one I
want, then I'll get it at Kleinman's.

50
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,484
They're having a huge sale.

51
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:58,925
- Thanks for the tip.
- When are you getting married?

52
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:03,965
- I'm not. I just like to try these on.
- I do the same thing.

53
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:08,534
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25.

54
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,367
I'm just kidding too.

55
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:14,111
I'm getting married in December.

56
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:18,416
- When are you getting married?
- May 15.

57
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:21,118
It's getting close.
Who's your photographer?

58
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:23,048
- Jeffrey.
- We met with him.

59
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,156
- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
- The best man? Wow!

60
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:31,461
I know.
I almost called off my wedding.

61
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:35,098
- Who's your band?
- My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

62
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:39,270
You're lucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

63
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:44,102
Is that spelled with a C or a K?
It doesn't matter, they're both great!

64
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:47,813
Oh, don't buy that here.

65
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:51,483
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's.

66
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,742
This place is so overpriced.

67
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,851
I own this store.

68
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,789
So does this come
in another color, or...?

69
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:13,096
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

70
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:15,206
- Moving in.
- Can I give you a hand?

71
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:20,037
Okay, but be careful. Guy who was helping
me had to leave because he hurt his back.

72
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,504
- Boyfriend?
- No.

73
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,340
I'm Joey.

74
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,018
Kristen.

75
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:28,948
What a beautiful name.

76
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,790
What is it again?

77
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,386
Kristen.

78
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:38,422
- You live around here?
- Right down there.

79
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,427
Let me give you a little tip.

80
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:45,193
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up with your shoes gone.

81
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:47,603
I'll remember that.

82
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:52,241
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

83
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:55,504
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

84
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,182
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

85
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:01,943
You look strong. Why don't I take that,
and you grab one of the boxes.

86
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,887
Yeah, I'll get this one.

87
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,137
So this is Brooklyn?

88
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:24,240
Listen up. There's usually only
one dress in each size.

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,775
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,674
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

91
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:37,817
When you locate the dress,
blow on these, all right?

92
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,952
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

93
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,094
Here he comes!

94
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,424
- They're pushing!
- Don't be a baby!

95
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:51,034
- Out of the way!
- Let's go!

96
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:54,228
Rachel?! Come on!

97
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:06,518
No, not it. Not it. Not it.

98
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:11,146
Don't crowd me.

99
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:16,518
This is it! This is the dress!
It's perfect!

100
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:18,764
I'm sorry, this one's taken!

101
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,562
- Megan!
- Monica!

102
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,359
- You came!
- Yeah!

103
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,195
- This is my dress!
- No!

104
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:31,169
- Yes it is. You saw me wearing it.
- And now you'll see me buying it.

105
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,469
You freak!

106
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,347
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

107
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,780
- Look, you don't want to fight me.
- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

108
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:45,356
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hey!

109
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:50,494
Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!

110
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:00,595
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

111
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,168
Did you find the dress?

112
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,602
No. Get me out of here.
These shoppers are crazy.

113
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:08,142
- We've gotta get Monica.
- You gotta hold my hand!

114
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:12,510
Excuse me! Excuse me!

115
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,552
Go! Go! Go!

116
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,062
So, Ross, how was your date
the other night?

117
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:35,103
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with every flush?

118
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:41,169
Laugh all you want, but she said
she'd like to go out again.

119
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,616
In fact, I'll go call her right now.

120
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:49,183
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says...

121
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,425
Sorry I didn't stop by last night,
but I had a date.

122
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:01,690
When it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by, that's okay.

123
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:06,597
It was with this really hot girl who
just moved in right across the street.

124
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:09,466
- Really? Right across the street?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,870
- When did you meet her?
- Two days ago.

126
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,578
Excellent!

127
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:17,980
You know, Ross met somebody too.

128
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,512
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

129
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:21,753
Great. We're going out again Saturday.

130
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:26,583
But I just found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

131
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,194
Really?

132
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:35,366
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

133
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:39,697
I sort of am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

134
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,963
But I'm not worried about it.

135
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:47,201
You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

136
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,541
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

137
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:56,216
So this is nice.

138
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,726
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

139
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,086
But I have to.

140
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:06,126
By the way, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

141
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:08,832
- Kristen Leigh.
- Bye.

142
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,373
Well, obviously only one of us
can keep dating her.

143
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:23,170
Obviously. So how do we decide?

144
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:26,715
Well, now,
let's look at this objectively.

145
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,113
I think I should date her.

146
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:35,888
Or I'm the one who dates her.

147
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:40,494
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

148
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,332
Okay, but to go
in another direction...

149
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,832
Okay. This can go on for a while.

150
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:49,006
- We should order some food, then.
- No, Joey.

151
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:53,875
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

152
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,842
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

153
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,515
And we'll see who she likes best.

154
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,746
That sounds fair.

155
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:06,649
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant.

156
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,918
Wait a second. We have
to set a spending limit on the date.

157
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:13,130
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that.

158
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:17,028
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

159
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:21,637
Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

160
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:30,377
- So let's decide on a spending limit.
- Yeah.

161
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,578
And a slice...

162
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,821
...$6?

163
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,386
- I was thinking more like 100.
- Okay.

164
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:47,291
Can I borrow $94?

165
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,232
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

166
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,011
You're out of Diet Coke.

167
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,423
Hello?

168
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:15,487
What? You what?

169
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,422
You listen here, missy!

170
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,666
That was Megan. She booked The Swing
Kings on the day of our wedding...

171
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:28,237
...and said I couldn't have them back
unless I gave her the dress!

172
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:31,338
Does that mean Carcass is available?

173
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:37,214
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is the dress!

174
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,080
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

175
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,983
- Figure out a way to talk him out of it.
- How?

176
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:47,248
You're out of toilet paper!

177
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,298
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

178
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,630
- Thanks.
- What time are you meeting?

179
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,876
We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.

180
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,273
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

181
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:13,083
- I am dressed.
- Oh, well, good.

182
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,217
For me.

183
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:19,918
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

184
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,626
I have an oily T-zone.

185
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,664
Okay, dude.

186
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,330
- You sent Kristen flowers?
- That's right.

187
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:36,135
You spent $ 100.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

188
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,945
I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

189
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,943
...I didn't break any rules.

190
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:46,081
Thanks for stopping by, though.

191
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:49,549
That's the way it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

192
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,188
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

193
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,358
- Why am I not surprised?
- Not gonna let you get away with this.

194
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,586
- I don't think you have much choice.
- We'll see!

195
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,292
Hey! So, just a light layer?

196
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,036
Yeah, just here and there.

197
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:15,838
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

198
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,912
Swing music is so out.

199
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:22,416
He's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

200
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:25,687
What are you guys talking about?

201
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:28,291
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

202
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:31,154
...and wondering whether they're
the right way to go.

203
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,695
I went to a wedding once
where they had swing music...

204
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,493
...and two months later,
the couple divorced.

205
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:40,933
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

206
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,368
...but they did tell me
that's why they got divorced.

207
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,569
But I love swing music!

208
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,337
But The Swing Kings?

209
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:54,779
They suck so much that people die at
their concerts. They just stop living.

210
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:58,715
All I know is that when Monica
and I went to see them, we had fun.

211
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:00,549
And there's another reason.

212
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:04,923
- Well, what is the other reason?
- I don't want to say.

213
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,564
Well, you have to
because maybe it's stupid.

214
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:14,195
It's just, while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

215
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,509
...it was the first time
I knew that...

216
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:22,275
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

217
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,843
Oh, crap.

218
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:38,126
- Our table will be ready in a few minutes.
- Oh, great.

219
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:41,423
- Is your back feeling better?
- Yeah, that's fine.

220
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,329
I guess the more muscles you have...

221
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:48,505
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

222
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,503
- Kristen?
- Joey!

223
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,547
- What are you doing here?
- I like this place.

224
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:02,310
And technically, I'm not
breaking any rules, so...

225
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:06,581
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

226
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:09,383
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

227
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:12,721
I used to have a friend named Joey.

228
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,129
I don't anymore.

229
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:20,369
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

230
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,474
Sure, I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

231
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,942
So, Joey, you look familiar.

232
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,810
Are you on TV or something?

233
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:36,111
Joey doesn't like to talk about it...

234
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:39,618
...but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.

235
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,495
That's right. Don't you play a woman?

236
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:50,333
A woman in a man's body.

237
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,604
Much better.

238
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,606
It's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

239
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:59,207
Have you ever been married?

240
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:01,880
Yes, I have.

241
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,274
In fact, just the other day...

242
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,486
...Kris and I were talking about how
I've been married and how I have a son.

243
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:12,588
- Little Eric.
- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

244
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:18,253
So you've just been married
the one time, then?

245
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:24,127
- Well...
- You've been married twice?

246
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:27,930
Yes. And...

247
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,698
...another time after that.

248
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,511
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

249
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:38,715
Have you ever been so hungry
on a date...

250
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:43,215
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat her food?

251
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:48,752
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

252
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:55,426
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up?

253
00:17:56,101 --> 00:18:00,504
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

254
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:05,000
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

255
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,906
Just seems like Ross is the kind of guy
who'd marry a woman...

256
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:12,446
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

257
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:19,688
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

258
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:25,897
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

259
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:28,893
You leave Marcel out of this!

260
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:32,537
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own leather pants?

261
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:37,207
Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

262
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:39,501
Monkey-lover!

263
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,349
Where do you think we lost her?

264
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:52,188
Probably around gonorrhea.

265
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,920
Geller, table of two?

266
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,921
- You hungry?
- Does a bear shit in the woods?

267
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,036
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- Don't come in here!

268
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:16,974
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

269
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:20,048
No. We only mess around at his place.

270
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:25,651
I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here, please?

271
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,549
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.

272
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,453
You got a wedding dress?

273
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:33,119
- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
- Then why can't I see it?

274
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:35,127
Oh. I guess you can.

275
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:38,336
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

276
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,596
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

277
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:51,074
Wow. You look hideous.

278
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,742
Really?

279
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:57,717
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

280
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,821
Why do you have to return it?

281
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,958
Because it doesn't really fit.

282
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:05,095
Oh, by the way, I
booked The Swing Kings.

283
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:08,128
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

284
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,893
But that dress is terrible.

285
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,502
- It makes me want to rip it off you.
- Okay.

286
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,367
But you can't rip it.

287
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,302
Well, maybe a little.

288
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:30,050
Guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

289
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:31,647
Guys?

290
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,916
I thought you were
gonna be gone all day.

291
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,717
All right, what's going on?

292
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:48,539
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

293
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:54,110
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes,
we'll have younger-looking skin.

294
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,545
You know, she could use a little...

295
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,782
Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
