1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,695
- Previously on Friends:
- I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,908
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,005
- Is this about Mark?
- Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,541
- Okay, it's not.
- Oh, my God.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,906
I cannot keep having
the same fight with you!

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,343
Look, maybe we should
just take a break.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,576
Fine. You're right.
Let's take a break.

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,980
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,383
No.

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,688
A break from us.

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,453
Then we had this big, stupid fight,
and I said I wanted to take a break.

12
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,493
I don't want to take a break.

13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,928
This is crazy.

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,797
Don't you think
we can work on this?

15
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,028
What do you want to drink?

16
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,363
Who's that?

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,509
Nobody.

18
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,766
Is that Mark?

19
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,137
Honey, look, he just...

20
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,911
Yeah. Got it!

21
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,149
Hey, come dance.
What, are you married?

22
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,112
Because that's okay.

23
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,664
How was the big anniversary dinner?

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,273
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

25
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,834
Nice.

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,674
No, we kind of broke up instead.

27
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,142
What?

28
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,454
My God, Monica!
It's on the ceiling!

29
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,713
That's okay.

30
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,047
This is more important than fruit...

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,958
...on my ceiling.

32
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,653
You broke up?

33
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,856
Yeah, but it's okay because
when Ross left, Mark came over.

34
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,602
- Oh, no! You and Mark?
- It's okay. Calm down.

35
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,302
Mark and I talked...

36
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,735
...and I realized how much
I love your stupid brother, and...

37
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,439
...yeah, we got our problems,
but I really wanna make it work.

38
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,262
Morning!

39
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:23,874
The One the Morning After

40
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,983
Hi, it's me. I've been trying
to reach you all night. I feel awful.

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,286
Please, Ross, you've gotta know
there's nothing between me and Mark.

42
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,726
This whole breakup thing
is just stupid.

43
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,262
I'm just so sorry I put you through it.

44
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,064
And I don't want to get
back together over a machine.

45
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,141
- So I love you.
- I love you.

46
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,710
And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now...

47
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:38,646
...but on my way to work tomorrow,
I'm gonna stop by around 8:30. Bye.

48
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,218
Chloe, how's it coming?

49
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,855
What kind of puppy do you think
I should get?

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,027
You know, I don't know.
How about a big one?

51
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,896
- But my apartment's so...
- Well, then a small one.

52
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,531
- Listen, we have to go.
- Wait! Where's my shoes?

53
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,530
You sure you need shoes?

54
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,636
Do I know why we're rushing?

55
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,034
Yeah, you know the girlfriend
I told you about?

56
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,311
Well, it turns out that she wants
to get back together with me.

57
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,636
I found it!

58
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,871
That's so great for you guys!

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,515
You must be so happy!

60
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,447
Yes, I am. One of the many
things I'm feeling.

61
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,519
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Oh, thank you.

62
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,869
- You got my message?
- You are right on time!

63
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,604
So, what do you say?
Can I be your girlfriend again?

64
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,330
Yes, you can. Very much.

65
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,342
- Why are you mopping your ceiling?
- There's banana on it.

66
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,946
I have the spirit of an
old Indian woman living in mine.

67
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,283
So then you know.

68
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,132
The mailman was downstairs,
so I brought up your mail.

69
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,233
- Oh, good. Thanks.
- Now, what is Fabutech?

70
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,566
All right, don't judge me
too much, okay?

71
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,174
But I saw this infomercial,
and I swear to you I have never, ever...

72
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,571
...bought anything on TV before.

73
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,608
Except for this mop.

74
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,713
But there was this stuff on leg-waxing.
It looked so amazing.

75
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,941
Waxine!

76
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,550
Yes! Have you seen it?

77
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,378
It's incredible!
I so want to be a Waxine Girl!

78
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,817
I know!

79
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,660
Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
Because how can they do that?

80
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,263
Hello! Organic substances recently
discovered in the depths of the rain forest?

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,199
They have the best stuff in there.

82
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,968
Oh, my God!

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,739
Oh, my God!

84
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,668
We figured when we couldn't find you,
you'd gone home to make up with Rachel.

85
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,074
Which is probably what
you should have done, huh?

86
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,983
You think?

87
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,610
God, I'm in hell.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

88
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,621
Rachel's all like, "I love you,"
and "Let's work on this"...

89
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,259
...and all I can think about...

90
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,952
...is what is she gonna do
when I tell her what I did?

91
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,960
Before we answer that, we should
address the more important question:

92
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,566
How dumb are you?

93
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,571
What? Look, we're trying to
rebuild a relationship here, right?

94
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,436
How am I supposed to do that
without being totally honest?

95
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,909
Ross, look, I'm onboard about
the total-honesty thing. I am.

96
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,777
Just not about stuff that's
gonna get you in trouble.

97
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,313
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit,
and you're just gonna hurt her.

98
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,218
Yeah, and there won't be
a relationship left to rebuild.

99
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,483
Don't you think...?

100
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,356
Look, if you absolutely have to tell her,
at least wait till the timing's right.

101
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,394
And that's what deathbeds are for.

102
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,403
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

103
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,765
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure
she doesn't find out some other way.

104
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,205
Did you think about the trail?

105
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,138
What trail?

106
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,585
The trail from the woman
you did it with...

107
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,779
...to the woman you hope
never finds out you did it!

108
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,458
You always have to think
about the trail!

109
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,693
I don't think there's any trail.

110
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,896
Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,265
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, and Jasmine
works at the massage place with Phoebe.

112
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,474
And Phoebe's friends with Rachel,
and that's the trail! I did it!

113
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,313
"After applying the Waxine
and linen strips to leg number one..."

114
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,573
- Did that!
- Okay.

115
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,217
"Grasp one of the linen strips
by its easy-grab tab...

116
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,387
...and pull it off in one quick,
pain-free motion."

117
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,418
Was it not "pain-free"?

118
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,559
No, it was pain-ful!

119
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,426
Oh, my God, they should call it
"Pain-zine, now with a little wax."

120
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,994
The girls in the satin nighties
on the commercial...

121
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,901
...don't seem to think it's that bad.

122
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,268
That's because their nerves are
deadened from being so stupid.

123
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:04,142
But, hey, you know, if you don't
believe me, please, be my guest.

124
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,346
Oh, my God!

125
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,981
Now aren't you glad we didn't
start with the bikini strips?

126
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,230
Chloe, hi.

127
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,092
Is this about me taking your watch?

128
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,263
- You took my watch?
- I'm sorry. I do that.

129
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,597
You keep it. Listen, did you
tell anyone about us?

130
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,971
Oh, no. I feel like it really isn't
anybody's business, you know?

131
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,273
Exactly. So you didn't mention
anything to Isaac, right?

132
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,247
- Oh, I tell Isaac everything.
- You do? Of course you do.

133
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,619
Hi, Isaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.

134
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,451
You dog!

135
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:55,734
Yes, I suppose I am a dog.
But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.

136
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,233
Oh, right, that Rachel chick
from the coffee place.

137
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,270
Yeah, that's the one.
Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

138
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,500
Oh, hey, man, I know. It doesn't
matter how much we love them.

139
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,008
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

140
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:13,315
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this
information to yourself?

141
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,079
Oh, no problem, dude.
We gotta look out for each other.

142
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,984
We're the same, you and me.

143
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,687
Actually, no, we're not.

144
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,261
Yeah, we are.

145
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,695
No, we're not.

146
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,197
Yeah, we are.

147
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,561
No, we're not.

148
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,069
- Okay, we're not.
- Right.

149
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,738
But we are.

150
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,445
Fine. I just need to know that
you're not gonna tell your sister.

151
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,579
I can promise not to tell her again.

152
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,815
Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's
birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.

153
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,357
You did a bad thing!

154
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,162
- Yes, I did.
- Very bad!

155
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,295
- Very bad.
- Very, very bad!

156
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,594
I'm agreeing with you.

157
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,360
Listen, did you happen
to tell Phoebe yet?

158
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,005
- No.
- Okay, Jasmine...

159
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,471
...please. Please don't.

160
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,166
I love my girlfriend very much...

161
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,007
...and I want more than anything
to just work it out with her, okay?

162
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,307
All right.

163
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,441
Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,812
But you should probably talk
to my roommate.

165
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,717
I told him,
and he knows Phoebe too.

166
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,417
Who's your roommate?

167
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,626
Gunther!

168
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,092
Gunther, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Rachel...

169
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,289
...about me and the girl
from the copy place.

170
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,229
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,265
Was I not supposed to?

172
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,620
Okay, I got an idea. Why don't you
pull off mine, and I pull off yours?

173
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,091
Or, you pull of yours,
and I will leave mine on...

174
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,987
...because I think
I can make this look work.

175
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,889
Come on, Phoebe. We can do this.

176
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,758
- All right.
- All right.

177
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,091
Okay.

178
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,840
- What is it?
- What's going on?

179
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,136
- We're all right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

180
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,706
- We were just waxing our legs.
- Off?

181
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,911
For your information...

182
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,087
...this happens to be a pain
like no man will ever experience.

183
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,485
I don't think you can make that
statement unless you've been kicked...

184
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,990
...in an area God only meant
to be treated nicely.

185
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,988
I think women just have a lower
threshold for pain than men, that's all.

186
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,860
I mean, come on,
it's just a little wax.

187
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,730
Oh, yeah? Come here.

188
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,304
Oh, that's mature.

189
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,044
Okay, fine.
So now what, I just pull it off?

190
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,643
That's right.

191
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,985
Okay, Tin Man.

192
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,826
Rachel, come on.
Talk to me. Please!

193
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,531
Talk to you?
I can't even look at you right now.

194
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,030
What?

195
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,861
Nothing. Nothing.

196
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,605
- Rachel said everything was okay.
- What are they talking about?

197
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,437
- Just get away from me!
- I made a mistake, okay?

198
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:29,637
A mistake? What were you trying
to put it in? Her purse?

199
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,076
Where did he put it?

200
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,484
Ross, you had sex with another woman!

201
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,717
Oh, my God!

202
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,588
I knew something had to be wrong...

203
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,390
...because my fingernails
did not grow at all yesterday.

204
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,797
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight,
and he got drunk...

205
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,828
You guys knew about this
and you didn't tell us?

206
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,541
He has sex and we get hit
in our heads!

207
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,609
Know what? I want you to leave!
Just get out! Now!

208
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,712
I want to stay.
I want to talk about this.

209
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,815
Okay. All right. How was she?

210
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,947
- What?
- Was she good?

211
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,182
Don't answer that.

212
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,987
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk about it. How was she?

213
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,865
- She was...
- Awful.

214
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,195
- She was not good.
- Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

215
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,131
She was different.

216
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,878
Good different?

217
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,178
Nobody likes change.

218
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,818
- Just stop!
- What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

219
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,884
Should we do something?

220
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,316
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

221
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,223
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself...

222
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,997
...and this morning
I was upset...

223
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,856
...and then I got your
message and I was so happy.

224
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,093
And all I wanted was to get her out
of my apartment...

225
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,272
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute.

226
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,501
What time did your
little friend leave?

227
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,246
Oh, my God. She was there?
She was still there?

228
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,646
She was in there when I was in there?

229
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,225
Listen, the important thing is,
she meant nothing to me.

230
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,124
And yet she was worth
jeopardizing our relationship!

231
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,929
I didn't think there was
a relationship.

232
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,503
- I thought we were broken up.
- We were on a break.

233
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,268
That, for all I knew, could last forever.
That, to me, is a breakup.

234
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,502
You gonna get out of this
on a technicality?

235
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,772
I'm not trying to "get out"
of anything, okay?

236
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,744
I thought our relationship was dead.

237
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,920
Well, you sure had a hell of a time
at the wake.

238
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,920
You know what? I don't think
we should listen to this anymore.

239
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,025
What are you doing?
We can't go out there.

240
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,457
Why not? I'm hungry.

241
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,589
Because they'll know
we've been listening.

242
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,834
God! And to have to hear about it
from Gunther!

243
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,436
Like I wanted him to tell you?

244
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,904
I ran all over the place trying
to make sure that didn't happen!

245
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,068
Oh, that is so sweet.

246
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,543
I think I'm falling in love with you
all over again.

247
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,386
I think we can go out. They have
more important things to worry about.

248
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,714
We'll be fine.

249
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,382
Look, Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should. I did.

250
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,289
And then Chandler and Joey
convinced me not to!

251
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,663
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.

252
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,039
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen, someone has
to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...

253
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,279
...because it's 9:15 now,
and I'm not there.

254
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,207
No, I'm in the middle
of a huge relationship fight, so...

255
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,546
Oh, that's all right.
It's not mine.

256
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,713
Don't you realize none of this would
ever have happened if I didn't think...

257
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,291
...at that same moment
you were having sex with Mark?

258
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,586
All right.

259
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,858
Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would
you have been able to forgive me?

260
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,100
Yes, I would.

261
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,872
You'd be okay if you knew...

262
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,840
...that Mark had kissed me,
and been naked with me...

263
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,603
...and made love to me?

264
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,241
Yes.

265
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:29,152
If you knew that our hot, sweaty,
writhing bodies were...

266
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,353
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I would have been devastated...

267
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,228
...but I would still want
to be with you.

268
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,324
Because, I mean, it's you.

269
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,039
What?

270
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,674
Come on, Rachel,
tell me what you're thinking.

271
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,147
I'm thinking...

272
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,822
...I'm gonna order a pizza.

273
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,687
Order a pizza, like...

274
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,526
..."I forgive you"?

275
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,829
Oh, man!

276
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,464
Pizza?

277
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,232
I like pizza.

278
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,140
Put olives on the pizza.

279
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,485
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

280
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,850
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

281
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,387
No, not the used wax.

282
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,959
Because that would be crazy?

283
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,801
Could I get in on that?
Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

284
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,300
Fine.

285
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,066
Hi, yes, I'd like to order
a large pizza.

286
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,639
- No anchovies.
- With extra anchovies.

287
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,014
That's okay.
I'll pick them off.

288
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,480
And could you please chop some up
and just put it right in the sauce?

289
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,317
You can have the last piece
if you want.

290
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,392
Well, I should think so.
You slept with someone.

291
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,570
They're gonna get through this,
aren't they?

292
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,742
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

293
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,973
They've got to.

294
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,317
What if they don't?

295
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,954
You think I need a new walk?

296
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,288
What?

297
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,298
Well, you know, I've been walking
the same way since high school.

298
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,468
You know how some guys walk into
a room and everybody takes notice?

299
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,797
I think I need a take-notice walk.

300
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,768
Are you actually saying these words?

301
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,148
What, now you're not even
talking to me?

302
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:20,421
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

303
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,125
I thought I'd lost you.

304
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
How insane must I have been
to do something like this?

305
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,624
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me. I'm not Joey!

306
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,801
Yeah, okay.

307
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,872
Hey!

308
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,673
It's 3 in the morning. They don't
know that I've come home yet.

309
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,443
You notice how neither one of them
are wondering where I am?

310
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,952
Yeah, you know, people
can be so self-involved.

311
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,283
You know what? I'm not the one
that wanted that break, okay?

312
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,190
You're the one that bailed on us.
You're the one...

313
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,628
...that ran the moment things
got a little rough.

314
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,993
- That's...
- That's what?

315
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,762
- That is neither here nor there.
- Here we are...

316
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,199
...in a tough spot again.
What do you want?

317
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,070
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?

318
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,975
Look, I did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing, okay?

319
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,013
And I'm sorry. I wish I could
take it back, but I can't.

320
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,485
I just can't see us throwing away
something we know is so damn good.

321
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,623
Rachel, I love you so much.

322
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,169
No, Ross! Don't!

323
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,744
You can't just kiss me and think
you're gonna make it all go away.

324
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,812
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.

325
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,315
Okay. Okay.

326
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,824
I think you should go.

327
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,316
What?

328
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,554
I really think you need to go now.

329
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,261
Okay. Okay.

330
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,204
This morning you said there was nothing
so big we couldn't work past it.

331
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,931
What the hell did I know?

332
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,211
There's got to be a way we
can work past this.

333
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:25,041
I can't imagine my life without you.
You know? Without...

334
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,847
Without these arms...

335
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,583
...and your face and heart...

336
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,759
...your good heart, Rach, and...

337
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,726
No.

338
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,763
I can't. You're a totally
different person to me now.

339
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:50,432
I used to think of you as somebody
that would never, ever hurt me.

340
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,800
Ever.

341
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,844
God, and now I can't stop
picturing you with her.

342
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,575
I can't. It doesn't matter what you
say or what you do.

343
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,547
It's just changed everything.

344
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,651
Forever.

345
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,069
This can't be it.

346
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,569
Then how come it is?

347
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,348
They've been quiet for a long time.

348
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,385
Maybe she killed him.

349
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,926
Let's go.

350
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,556
Is that your new walk?

351
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,360
No. I really have to pee.
