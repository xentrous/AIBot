1
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:05,848
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate...

2
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:08,955
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,089
Now, Ross, repeat after me.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,085
"I, Ross."

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,490
I, Ross.

6
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:17,322
"Take thee, Emily."

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,158
Take thee, Rachel.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:31,510
Shall I go on?

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,646
He said, "Rachel," right?

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,148
Do you think I should go up there?

11
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,820
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

12
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:41,320
I think we'd better start again.

13
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,049
Repeat after me.

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,352
"I, Ross."

15
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,856
I, Ross.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,155
"Take thee, Emily."

17
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,799
Take thee, Emily.

18
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:58,841
Like there'd be anybody else.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,139
"As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

20
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,972
...till death parts us."

21
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:10,915
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

22
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:13,747
...until death parts us.

23
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:16,252
Really, I do. Emily.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,525
Do you have the rings?

25
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,192
Place this ring on Ross' finger...

26
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:26,197
...as a symbol of
your bond everlasting.

27
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,207
Ross, place this ring...

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,435
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

29
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,113
...of the love that
encircles you forever.

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,077
Happy to.

31
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,279
They have made
their declarations...

32
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:50,117
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

33
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,227
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,401
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

35
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,571
Just keep smiling.

36
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:15,114
Well, that went well.

37
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,880
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

38
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,220
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

39
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:28,430
The One After Ross Says "Rachel"

40
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:17,105
You spoiled everything!
It's a nightmare!

41
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:21,807
My friends and family are out there!
How can I face them?

42
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,245
No matter what happens with them...

43
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,977
...we still get cake, right?

44
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:33,224
That's all right. You take your time.
I'll be right out here.

45
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,063
She's just fixing her makeup.

46
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,422
I hate you!

47
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:41,330
And I love you!

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,231
A bad time
to say the wrong name, huh?

49
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,812
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

50
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,908
People should be dancing.

51
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,780
This is a party! Come on!

52
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,614
Joey! Dance!

53
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,768
Yes, Waltham Interiors.

54
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,532
This is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Filangie.

55
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,432
Who?

56
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:25,512
I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

57
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,377
Without it, in the brain of Ross...

58
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:31,815
...women's names are interchangeable.

59
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,182
Through no fault of his own.

60
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,288
Oh, my God! Phoebe.

61
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,727
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.

62
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,989
Oh, no! You have it too!

63
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,268
What kind of bitch hangs up
on a doctor?

64
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,071
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

65
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,217
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight.

66
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:06,922
I'm worried about what it
might do to our friendship.

67
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,084
I know.

68
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:13,418
-How could we have let this happen?
-Seven times!

69
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,229
You know, look.
We were away.

70
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,560
In a foreign, romantic country.

71
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,504
I blame London.

72
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,105
Bad London!

73
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,767
So look...

74
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:32,047
...while we're still in London,
we can keep doing it, right?

75
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,739
Well, I don't see that
we have a choice.

76
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,880
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

77
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,452
Only here.

78
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,457
You know, I saw
a wine cellar downstairs.

79
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,419
I'll meet you there in two minutes.

80
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,865
Mon? I gotta ask you something.

81
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,123
Now?

82
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:56,566
Ross said my name.
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.

83
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,438
I don't know.

84
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,803
Monica, what should I do?

85
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,671
Just do the right thing.

86
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,109
What?

87
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,376
Tow the line! Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!

88
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,782
I'll talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

89
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,283
Wait! Rachel, no.

90
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,582
He's married.

91
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,388
Married.

92
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,586
If you don't realize that,
I can't help you.

93
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,766
Okay. You're right.

94
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,457
You're right.
You can't help me.

95
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,604
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

96
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,768
Who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

97
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,776
How are you supposed to eat this?

98
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,448
Hey, what's up?

99
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,680
You and me, next dance?

100
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,754
Sorry, dear,
I only dance when I'm drunk.

101
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,983
Want me to get you something?

102
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,757
We were supposed to meet.

103
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,987
-Forget it. That's off.
-Why?

104
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:59,291
The next tour of the wine cellar...

105
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,704
...will commence in two minutes.

106
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,132
Joey, what are you doing?

107
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,504
You promised, no meat
till Phoebe has the babies.

108
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,476
We're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

109
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,045
-True.
-He's got a point.

110
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,788
I'm sorry things aren't working out.

111
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,324
It could be better.
It'll be okay, right?

112
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,658
Oh, yeah! Of course.
She'll get over this.

113
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,333
So you said my name.

114
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,129
You just said it
because you saw me there.

115
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,966
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

116
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,141
"I take thee, Circus Freak."

117
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:44,041
It didn't mean anything.
It's a mistake.

118
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:47,580
It didn't mean anything.
Right?

119
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:51,685
Oh, no! Of course
it didn't mean anything.

120
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:55,254
I can understand why Emily
thought it meant something...

121
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,719
...because it was you.

122
00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:00,360
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't! It didn't!

123
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,892
The band's ready
for your first dance with Emily.

124
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:07,831
Oh! The band's ready!

125
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:12,838
We've got to do what the band says.
I don't care about the stupid band!

126
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,440
You spit on me, man!

127
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,247
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,516
Emily is taking kind of a long time.

129
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,913
When I locked myself up
at my wedding...

130
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:28,386
...I was trying to pop
the window out of the frame.

131
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:31,593
Get the hell out of there.
You know?

132
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:40,695
I'm coming in!

133
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,105
Oh, look at that.
Same thing.

134
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:55,073
In the middle of everything,
if I scream, "Yippee!" just ignore me.

135
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:01,223
-Oh, my God! Rachel!
-Oh, hello, Rachel.

136
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,159
Ross said my name.

137
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,894
Okay? My name!

138
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,958
Ross said my name up there.

139
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,632
That obviously means
he still loves me!

140
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,758
Don't believe me.
I know I'm right.

141
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:16,130
Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

142
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,633
Yes, we do.

143
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,276
But we have to change first.

144
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,171
Yes, I want to change.

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,313
-Go get a table.
-We'll only be five minutes.

146
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,107
Fifteen minutes.

147
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,449
Oh, Phoebe! It's Phoebe!

148
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,684
-Oh, hey, hey.
-Oh, great.

149
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,092
So, what happened?

150
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,787
Well, Ross said my name.

151
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,000
But I don't think
that means anything.

152
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,295
Let's look at this objectively.

153
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:49,970
Ninth grade, right?

154
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,639
The obsession starts.

155
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,939
Then he sees me in
a two-piece for the first time.

156
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,443
His obsession begins to grow, right?

157
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,882
Why don't we go change in my room?

158
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,517
My clothes are...

159
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:20,861
Wow, you look

160
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,536
No time for that.

161
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:30,134
Hey, dude! Let me in!
I got a girl out here!

162
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:32,906
I got a girl in here!

163
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,247
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.

164
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,212
Well, we're hanging out.

165
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:46,261
Which one of us will be
having sex in there? Me or you?

166
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,729
I suppose I would
have to say you.

167
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,260
-What if we're watching a movie?
-Which we are!

168
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,061
And we've paid for it.

169
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,533
It's My Giant.

170
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,865
My Giant?

171
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,169
I love that movie!

172
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,445
Think this is okay?

173
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,551
Well, Ross and Emily
aren't going to use it.

174
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,048
Oh, it's so beautiful!

175
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,854
I don't feel right about this.

176
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,727
This is the honeymoon suite.

177
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,366
The room expects sex.

178
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,763
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,806
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

180
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,980
Nope! Not under here!

181
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,287
-You didn't find her?
-I've looked everywhere.

182
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:51,151
You couldn't have,
or you would've found her.

183
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:54,090
-Keep looking!
-Yeah! For about 30 minutes?

184
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,729
Or 45?

185
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,061
In 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

186
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:09,636
For all I know, she's trying to find me
but couldn't, because I kept moving.

187
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,573
From now on,
I'm staying in one place.

188
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,248
Right here.

189
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,487
-It's getting late.
-We're going to go.

190
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:24,586
Do you guys mind staying here
for a while?

191
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:28,488
We've got to get up early
and catch that plane.

192
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,688
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

193
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,702
That's cool.

194
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,830
But we'll stay here with you.

195
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,643
Thanks, guys!

196
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:48,007
I really appreciate this,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

197
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,890
We have to leave in an hour.

198
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,795
I know. I've been looking
at those doors.

199
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,972
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

200
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,671
We can't do that.
That's insane.

201
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:17,412
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

202
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,045
...let's go for it.

203
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,758
Nope.

204
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,756
-She's not with us.
-We've come for her things.

205
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,056
Where is she?

206
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,599
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.

207
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:46,931
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

208
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,240
But I think you're
absolutely delicious!

209
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,942
Excuse me,
I'm standing right here.

210
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,548
Oh, yes.

211
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,915
There you are.

212
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,754
Hurry up! Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.

213
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,021
Goodbye, Geller.

214
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,198
Now, hold on. Hold on.

215
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:16,370
Your daughter and I are supposed
to leave tonight for our honeymoon.

216
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:20,836
Tell her I'll be at that airport,
and I hope she will too.

217
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,403
I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

218
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,874
She's just a friend.

219
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,911
Tell Emily I love her and...

220
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:31,448
...I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

221
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:35,123
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

222
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,149
All right, I'll tell her.

223
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,692
Come on, bugger face!

224
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,524
Call me.

225
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:48,763
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?

226
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:09,183
Maybe it's best we never
got to do it again.

227
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:12,519
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

228
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,960
Technically, we still are
over international waters.

229
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:25,034
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?

230
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,015
Can I ask you something?

231
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:41,714
Felicity and I watched
My Giant. And I thought:

232
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:45,189
"I'll never be as good an actor
as that giant."

233
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:49,056
Do you think I'm wasting my life
with this acting thing?

234
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,824
The giant's five years
younger than me.

235
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,933
You think I'll ever get there?

236
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,509
-Thanks, man.
-Okay, man.

237
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,713
But what about how much
taller he is than me?

238
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:10,608
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

239
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,584
Who knows what science will
come up with in the future...

240
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,554
...but what if I die an unsuccessful,
regular-size man?

241
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:23,588
You've been in the
bathroom for a half-hour.

242
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,455
I know!

243
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,263
Had the beef tips, huh?

244
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,713
You ate meat!

245
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,050
You had sex!

246
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:54,451
No, we didn't.

247
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,827
I know you didn't.
I was talking about Monica.

248
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,735
I did not have sex.

249
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,999
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
and making me fat.

250
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,905
-I'll say hi to the chick and duck.
-Me too!

251
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,806
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.

252
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,044
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll just go home.

253
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,227
We certainly are alone.

254
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,296
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

255
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,561
Listen, since we're on that subject...

256
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,466
...I just wanted to tell you that...

257
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,733
I was going through
a hard time in London...

258
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:47,142
...with my brother getting married and
that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

259
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,476
Well, anyway, I just...

260
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:54,178
That night meant a lot to me.
And I'm trying to say thanks.

261
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,985
You know, that night
meant a lot to me too.

262
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:04,426
It wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

263
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,829
It just meant a lot because
you're really hot.

264
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:13,298
Is that okay?

265
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,840
That's okay.

266
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:16,867
And I'm cute too?

267
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,641
And you're cute too!

268
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,941
Thank you.

269
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,845
All right, I gotta go unpack.

270
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,471
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

271
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,033
-Oh, that counts!
-Oh, good!

272
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,589
What are you doing here?

273
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:06,191
I've been on standby for
a flight home for hours.

274
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,228
So no sign of Emily?

275
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,925
Not yet.

276
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,063
When do you have to leave?

277
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:22,141
This is the last call
for flight 1066 to A thens.

278
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:23,868
The last call.

279
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,842
Pretty soon, I guess.

280
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:29,916
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,511
I don't understand.

282
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:34,621
How could she do this?

283
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:39,226
Am I a complete idiot for
thinking she'd actually show up?

284
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:45,027
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.

285
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,399
Same difference.

286
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:52,700
All passengers for flight 1066
to Athens should now be onboard.

287
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,374
I get it!

288
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,371
Well, that's that.

289
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,940
No, you know what?

290
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,448
I think you should go.

291
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,813
I think you should go...

292
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,422
...by yourself.
Get some distance.

293
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,321
Clear your head.
It would be really good.

294
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,257
I don't know.

295
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,160
Come on.
It would be really good for you.

296
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,729
I could do that.

297
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,900
I can't even believe her.

298
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,009
You know what?
I am going to go.

299
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:30,404
-Good.
-Why not?

300
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:31,636
-Right?
-Right.

301
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,136
Thanks.

302
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,815
I'll see you back at home.

303
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,176
If I ever get a flight out of here.

304
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:42,420
What? Wait, what?

305
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,457
Why don't you come?

306
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,755
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?

307
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,661
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?

308
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,298
Yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

309
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,370
You can lay on the beach...

310
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,941
...and I can cry over
my failed marriage.

311
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,338
You see how I make jokes?

312
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:07,445
Really. I mean...

313
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,841
I could use a friend.

314
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:13,610
Oh, wow. Maybe.

315
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,385
Yes, I can do that!

316
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,320
-Cool.
-All right, cool.

317
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:24,458
Okay, we're going to Greece.

318
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,565
I forgot my jacket!

319
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,032
Well, you tell them to wait.

320
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,737
Wait! Wait!

321
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:54,519
I'll have a glass of Merlot...

322
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:57,492
...and he'll have
a wine spritzer.

323
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,206
Look!
The airport's moving.

324
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,069
Are we moving?

325
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,403
Are we?
Why are we moving?

326
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,009
Does the captain know
that we're moving?

327
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:18,641
Oh, my gosh!
