1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,034
Oh, man!

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,540
-What's that?
-Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,973
What in the name of hell?

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,983
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,685
Is this porn?

6
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,760
I must have hit something
on the remote.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,590
Do we pay for this?

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,166
We didn't even pay our cable bill.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,668
Maybe this is how they punish us.

10
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,572
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

11
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:47,074
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

12
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,414
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,286
Joey pressed something on the remote
and it just came on.

14
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,085
It happened to me once.
It was like finding money.

15
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:06,129
Finding money
with naked people on it!

16
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,357
But I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

17
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,002
I never got it back again.

18
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,261
And I'm sad.

19
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,809
Why would he turn off the TV?

20
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,108
The One with the Free Porn

21
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,703
Do we really have to watch this
while we eat?

22
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,870
We don't know
what could make this go away.

23
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,336
So no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

24
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,678
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

25
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,656
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

26
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,387
I'm at least going to mute it.

27
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,858
We still have porn.

28
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,270
What are you doing?
That's too heavy. Give it here.

29
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,834
Oh, God.

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:06,380
I'm too pregnant for lugging
around a stupid massage table.

31
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,053
I need a job with a smaller table.

32
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,189
Or a job without a table.

33
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,255
You mean, like a doctor?

34
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,459
You're blocking the porn!

35
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,064
That reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

36
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,745
Emily just went to the airport.

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,447
Why didn't you take her?

38
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,683
Her uncle had planned to do it.

39
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,842
We said our goodbyes this morning.

40
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,649
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

41
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,858
Hey, cheer up.
You'll see her again, right?

42
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,727
I don't know.

43
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,063
When I brought it up, she said...

44
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,604
..."This is so fantastic.
Why talk about the future?

45
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,971
-Let's enjoy"
-Don't do the accent. It really bums me out.

46
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,076
Emily said I was pretty good.

47
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,116
Well, that's someone
you should hang on to.

48
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,277
You've got to see her again.

49
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,780
-Why do you care?
-Because!

50
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,922
You could live out my fantasy.

51
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,517
You had fantasies about Emily?

52
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,056
You know, the fantasy.

53
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,636
Meet a foreigner, fall madly in love
and spend your lives together.

54
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,239
Is that why you hung out
with that Ukrainian kid in school?

55
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:42,706
Yeah, plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

56
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,339
Do you love her?

57
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,747
We said it would only be two weeks.

58
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,480
You love her.

59
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,660
What is love, really?

60
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,991
I knew you loved her!

61
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,494
You go to the airport and tell her.

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,669
You'll probably catch her at the gate.

63
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,667
You'll call her name
and yell "I love you!"

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,168
She'll say "I love you too!"

65
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,605
Then you will have
the most amazing kiss.

66
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,144
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

67
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,174
I am a good kisser.

68
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,114
Then you two can sneak
into the cockpit.

69
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,788
Things will start to heat up.

70
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,587
And then a stewardess comes in...

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,265
I've been watching too much porn.

72
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,306
-Is that the heartbeat?
-That's it.

73
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,532
Oh, my God!

74
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,609
This is so cool!

75
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,937
Have we talked about multiple births?

76
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,850
Let's take care of this one. If I
get pregnant again, I have your card.

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,951
No, I'm getting
three separate heartbeats.

78
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,589
You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

79
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,022
Doctors are wrong all the time.

80
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,466
Are you sure that there are three?

81
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,195
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.

82
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:24,508
So in a few months, I'll have three
babies walking around inside me?

83
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:31,215
It'll be like one of those log rides
when they come shooting out.

84
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,953
Giving birth to three
is like giving birth to one.

85
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,495
What do you know?

86
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,498
-Have you ever had triplets?
-No. I'm sorry, I haven't.

87
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,761
I'm going to use this a lot.

88
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,642
How'd it go at the doctor's?

89
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,414
You know how, when you're
walking down the street...

90
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,317
...and you see three people in a row.

91
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,651
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,492
Good news!
You'll have three babies.

93
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,568
Three babies?

94
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,744
I've finally got my band!

95
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,106
We'll have a big family!
I always wanted a big family.

96
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:36,153
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're happy!
I was afraid you'd be freaked.

97
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,022
Why would we be freaked?

98
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:43,558
Because it's harder to raise them
and the added expense.

99
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,525
Right.

100
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,260
No, back to happy.
Back to happy!

101
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,708
It's going to be fine...

102
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,509
...because I teach home ec.

103
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,740
I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

104
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:09,581
It'll be like my very own
little sweatshop.

105
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,587
I was thinking, ever since
you said we'd have triplets.

106
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,357
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

107
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,196
No, you can't quit college.

108
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,835
You're in college?

109
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,831
Refrigerator college.

110
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,610
When we found out
we were having a baby...

111
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,181
...I figured I should have
a career, you know?

112
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,319
And I love refrigerators.

113
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,946
You can't give up on your dream!

114
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,991
No, it's okay.
We're going to have three kids.

115
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,322
And that's a different kind of dream.

116
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,362
Three kids and no money.

117
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,067
This is the boarding call
for flight 009.

118
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,072
What are you doing here?

119
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,215
I had to see you
before you took off.

120
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,412
You are so sweet.

121
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,152
That's a big candy bar.

122
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,393
I had the most amazing time with you.

123
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,928
Me too.

124
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,130
This is the final boarding call
for flight 009.

125
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,038
Well, that's me.

126
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,642
Here, have this.

127
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,750
I'm only allowed
one piece of carry-on.

128
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,259
Listen, I have to tell you something.

129
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,425
I've been thinking.

130
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,563
I'm just going to say it, okay?

131
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,663
I think...

132
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,998
...I love you.

133
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,675
Thank you.

134
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,052
It's no problem.

135
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,065
What is that song?

136
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,471
It's the theme
from Good Will Humping.

137
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,010
You know who doesn't like
dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.

138
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,979
Yeah, right.

139
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,848
He said he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

140
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,686
Did he also say that
the dialogue was corny?

141
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:07,058
-And that he found it funny, not sexy?
-Yes.

142
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
Yeah, he likes porn.

143
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,927
Where you going?

144
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,598
To find out if he really
thinks models are too skinny.

145
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,735
How'd it go?

146
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,107
Frank has to quit college...

147
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,819
...because his super-fertile
sister's having three babies.

148
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,990
I need to make money fast.
I wanted to talk to you about an idea.

149
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,093
You work for a big company.

150
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,420
Insider trading.

151
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,695
What information can you give me?

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,434
They don't talk to us
about that stuff.

153
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,728
But I can get you free White-Out.

154
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,172
-Did you do what I said?
-I did.

155
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,006
-What'd she say?
-"Thank you."

156
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,507
You're totally welcome.
What'd she say?

157
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,586
She said, "Thank you."

158
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,189
I said, "I love you."

159
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,417
And she said, "Thank you."

160
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,228
That's not right.

161
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,334
Did you say you love her?

162
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,300
What were you trying
to get her to do?

163
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,769
-What do I do now?
-You play hard-to-get.

164
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,136
She already lives in London.

165
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,815
So you go to Tokyo.

166
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,483
Forget it.

167
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,517
You told her you love her.
It's over.

168
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,816
It is not over!
You're over!

169
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,661
What?

170
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,529
You know.

171
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,566
Good one.

172
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,976
It's not over. She'll call
and tell you she loves you.

173
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,375
Her feelings were so strong
that it scared her.

174
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:07,075
Go home and wait for her call.
She could call from the plane.

175
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,685
But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over!

176
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,760
Unless, eventually, I call her
to see what's going on...

177
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,058
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

178
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,202
Then it's over!

179
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,394
Way to be strong!

180
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,911
Can we watch cartoons on your TV?

181
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,450
We need a porn break.

182
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,657
We spent two hours watching
In and Out and In Again.

183
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,485
Why don't you turn it off?

184
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,199
Then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

185
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,666
Yeah, but that's not
what you'd go by.

186
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,739
Look, I'm going
to have a kid someday. Okay?

187
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,604
And someday that kid is going to ask me
if I ever turned off free porn.

188
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,709
I don't wanna have to tell him that I did.

189
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,315
Did you ever asked you dad that?

190
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,610
I don't want to talk about it.

191
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,978
Good, you're here!

192
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,586
What you got there?

193
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,659
This? I'm glad you asked.

194
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:30,826
Don't you hate to cut a tin can
with an ordinary steak knife?

195
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,171
I know what you're thinking.

196
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,173
Pregnant woman slays four?

197
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,176
-Did they make you pay for those knives?
-No.

198
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,283
-Are you sure?
-No.

199
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,245
You won't make enough money
by selling knives.

200
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:54,620
I just need enough money
for the second part of my plan.

201
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,090
-What's that?
-My Saturn dealership.

202
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,763
Hello.

203
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,469
-Ross.
-Emily. Hi.

204
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,681
How was your flight?

205
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,177
It was dreadful.

206
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,821
It was terrible how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

207
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,420
No, that's all right.

208
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,126
I'm just glad you called.

209
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,956
Ross, there's something
that I've got to tell you.

210
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,235
There's someone else.

211
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,838
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

212
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,514
She doesn't know who she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.

213
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,587
So I told her when she figures it out,
give me a call. Maybe I'll still be around.

214
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:01,419
When you say "still around," you mean still
around like you might be in a relationship...

215
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,927
...or still around like you might have died
waiting for the phone to ring?

216
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,031
But it was so right.

217
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:13,535
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
There can't be another guy.

218
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,341
Of course, there's another guy!

219
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,543
This is even more perfect.

220
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,946
You have to prove your love!

221
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:27,083
I'm not proving anything.
I'm done listening to you.

222
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,550
If I hadn't let you talk me
into this...

223
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,451
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

224
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,249
You did that?

225
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,790
I missed and hit the door.

226
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,161
But it opened really hard.

227
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,926
You have to go to London.
You have to go fight for her.

228
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,730
That makes sense.

229
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,067
You said you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

230
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,736
Then she told you about another guy.
Go to London. Scare her!

231
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,981
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

232
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,178
I made fun of his accent.

233
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,517
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight.

234
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,720
I just told you,
I made fun of him behind his back.

235
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,660
Oh, I see.

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,698
-You want that to happen with Emily?
-No.

237
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,770
All right then, go fight for her!

238
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,440
It's like a snake pit.

239
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,439
That could be you and Emily.

240
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,341
That but nicer.

241
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,313
Go to London!

242
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,277
Really?

243
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:42,052
Surprise her.
Don't let her go without a fight.

244
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,125
All right. I'm going to do it.

245
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,789
I'm going to London,
and I'll fight for her.

246
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,629
Okay. Good luck!

247
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:58,170
Can you pick me up one
of those Toblerone bars at the airport?

248
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,619
I did it!
I figured out a way to make money.

249
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,791
I'll open a massage place.
Frank will help me.

250
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,224
We'll work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

251
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,063
But how can you afford it?

252
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,734
We were walking down the street,
and we saw your van.

253
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,302
-And we realized
-I'm telling it!

254
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,542
People need transportation,
and they need massages to relax.

255
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:38,374
We can combine the two.
I give massages and Frank drives.

256
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,381
I'll bolt a table in the van,
and you know what I've got?

257
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,555
A place that no one
will get out of alive?

258
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,990
Think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

259
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,825
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!

260
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,299
The name was my favorite part!

261
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,105
-I came up with it.
-You did not!

262
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,207
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

263
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,946
Oh, my god! Are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

264
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,182
No, she hasn't come home yet.

265
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,058
She hasn't been home all night.
She must be with the other guy.

266
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,028
I'm the stupid moron
who spent the night here.

267
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,729
-What was that?
-I just put my fist through another wall.

268
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,395
Tell the guys.

269
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,867
When is the next flight out?

270
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,169
About four hours.

271
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,178
Stay there for a while.
If she doesn't show up, come home.

272
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,647
There's a girl at the restaurant
that would be perfect for you.

273
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,212
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

274
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,721
Ask him if he likes it
better than Relaxi-Cab.

275
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,020
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

276
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,392
That is better.

277
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,365
Do you have any 8's?

278
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,029
No.

279
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,614
Are we in London?

280
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,686
Why are you here?
You can't be here.

281
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,824
I've come to talk to Ross.

282
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,751
What?

283
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,458
Nothing.

284
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,468
I was going to call him

285
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,606
You came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

286
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,068
I was right!
I'm right, right?

287
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,704
I'd rather talk to him.

288
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,982
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

289
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,982
I need to talk to him.
Do you know where he is?

290
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,162
Ross, are you there?

291
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:15,197
Ross, I don't know if you hear this,
but I'll talk anyway.

292
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,567
I'm in the States
with your sister and friends.

293
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,008
It's all over with Colin.

294
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,411
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you

295
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,178
Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want.

296
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:37,026
I came here to tell you
that I love you.

297
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,257
I love you too!

298
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:43,023
I'll call you right now
from the phone booth.

299
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,065
You can't hear me.

300
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,272
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.

301
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,875
I suppose I've given
my neighbors a good laugh.

302
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,445
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. None of your business.

303
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,814
There's not much chance
you did hear that.

304
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,816
There's the call waiting...

305
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,821
...so I should go.

306
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,517
Oh, well.

307
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,629
Ross, I love you.

308
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,000
Thank you.

309
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,485
I was just at the bank.
There was this really hot teller...

310
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,720
...and she didn't ask me
to do it with her in the vault.

311
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,124
Same thing happened to me.

312
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:52,062
Pizza delivery girl comes over,
gives me the pizza and leaves!

313
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,569
No "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

314
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,672
Nothing!

315
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,677
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

316
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,507
I think you're right.

317
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,240
Ready?

318
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,749
One, two, three.

319
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,153
That's kind of nice.

320
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,093
That's kind of a relief.

321
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,262
You want to see
if we still have it?

322
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,702
-Free porn!
-We have free porn!

323
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,784
There's one, two and three.

324
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,091
-Oh, my God.
-That's so beautiful.

325
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,195
-Oh, man.
-I can't believe it.

326
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,557
I know.

327
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,798
I like the middle one the best.

328
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,330
Don't worry,
I won't let the other two know.
