1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,369
Pick a card.

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,464
All right. Now, memorize it.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,900
-You got it?
-Oh, yes.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,805
Is that your card?

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,348
Yes.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,652
-Hey, guys.
-Hi there!

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,420
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,457
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,254
It's not for sure, but...

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,592
...we met this guy in the park
who thought Ben was cute.

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,133
You know, which he is.
He gave us his card...

12
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,705
...and told us to bring him
for this commercial he's auditioning.

13
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,541
This guy's the biggest commercial
casting director in town!

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,546
Ben takes one lousy walk
in the park and gets an audition?

15
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,851
I mean, way to go, Ben!

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,051
I've been in that park a million times
and no one's offered me an audition.

17
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,822
It's crazy. We were pushing
Ben on the swings

18
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,693
I'm always on the swings!

19
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,262
What am I doing wrong?

20
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,093
That.

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,568
The One Where Rachel Smokes

22
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,651
-Gotta go. Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

23
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,121
Since you work at Ralph Lauren,
can you get me some shirts?

24
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:13,425
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable
stealing on my very first day.

25
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,598
Unwilling to steal from work.

26
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,100
Interesting.

27
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,971
If anybody gets free stuff,
it's me.

28
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,506
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

29
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,366
Go get 'em!

30
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,473
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

31
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,945
I say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.

32
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,482
But her birthday's
not for another month.

33
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,951
If we throw her party on her birthday,
it's not a surprise.

34
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,320
Great! We can have a dinner party
and just invite her close friends.

35
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,690
Ross! We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.

36
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,324
Done.

37
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,202
Great. Wanna do it together?

38
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,199
I'd love to do it together!

39
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,468
They're gonna do it together.

40
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,376
That's my girlfriend.

41
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,242
So I gotta shut it down now?

42
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,845
I gotta go.
I'm picking up Ben...

43
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,420
...and then we're off
to the big audition.

44
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,181
It's gonna be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.

45
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,419
Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?

46
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,063
Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?

47
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,565
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and pretend to enjoy it.

48
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,569
Maybe I'll go with you
and audition as the dad.

49
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,208
Who better to play Ben's father
than his godfather?

50
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,944
-You're not his godfather.
-What?

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,713
Are you kidding?

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,842
Of course I am.

53
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,856
-Okay, let's go, godfather.
-All right!

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,297
They're gonna let me audition!

55
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,899
Really? That's great!

56
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,662
One of the casting ladies
has actually seen me in a play.

57
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,465
So I steered clear of her.

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,631
And the other one, I know from...

59
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,743
Well, you know.

60
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,637
-That kid looks familiar.
-Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,750
He's done tons of commercials.
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...

62
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,748
...and that one
for the phone company.

63
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,890
He was so good, he convinced me
to switch phone companies.

64
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,854
Chandler was mad.

65
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,991
He's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.

66
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,426
I mean, look at him.

67
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,396
That's great.

68
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,508
Wouldn't it be great
if I got to play Ben's dad?

69
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,110
You look nothing like Ben.

70
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,946
I look more like him than you do.

71
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,552
I really don't know you
well enough for you to do that.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,462
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one.

73
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,292
I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?

74
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,934
Well, that one is pretty...

75
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,628
...but I just love this fabric.

76
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,795
Sorry.

77
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,875
Don't be. Part of your job
is to give your opinions.

78
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,203
Then I take credit for them.
I'm kidding!

79
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,312
She is kidding. But don't ever
disagree with her again.

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,415
Okay, now I'm kidding!

81
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,882
What a fun office.

82
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,489
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.

83
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,423
Let's take a break, go outside
and sort this out when we return.

84
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,093
-You smoke?
-No.

85
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:40,102
My dad's a doctor. And he would
always tell me horror stories...

86
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,274
About ghosts and goblins...

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,343
...who totally supported
the princess' right to smoke.

88
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,517
And then they came back from smoking
and they'd made all of the decisions.

89
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,285
-That's not fair.
-I know.

90
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,159
It's like I'm being punished for not having
this disgusting, poisonous habit.

91
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,162
Yeah, it is the best.

92
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,362
What if this keeps happening?

93
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,868
They'll be smoking,
making the decisions...

94
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,442
...and I'll be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.

95
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,113
And when Kim wants
to promote one of us...

96
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,682
...who do you think she'll pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?

97
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,885
We used to have
a smoking area at work.

98
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,614
It was great. There was this
big flowerpot with dirt in it.

99
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,985
We used to put our cigarettes out in it.

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,151
One of the old-timers told me
there used to be a little tree in there.

101
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,458
You can go down there and not smoke.
Say you want some fresh air.

102
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,636
I could do that.

103
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,239
Or you could do
the easy thing and smoke.

104
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,277
You gotta take long, deep drags.

105
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,039
Wow, I still don't have
my lung capacity back yet.

106
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,047
Rach, do you wanna go get coffee?

107
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,221
-I would love to.
-Oh, good.

108
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,686
I'm gonna go too.

109
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,018
Oh, good.

110
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,992
Oh, I changed my mind.

111
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,263
Let's talk about the party.
I have so many ideas.

112
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,936
Me too!

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,067
Oh, look at that.

114
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,243
This is a little sketch
of the cake. See?

115
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,071
Some sample menus.

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,217
I thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.

117
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,420
And for music, here's an
alphabetized list of all of my CDs.

118
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,783
I've highlighted the ones
that'll go with the food.

119
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,124
-What about the intimate dinner party?
-We're not doing that.

120
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,761
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

121
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,770
Wait a minute. There's plenty
of things for you to do.

122
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,771
Like what?

123
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,798
Cups.

124
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,779
You're giving me cups?

125
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,636
And ice.

126
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,281
Cups and ice? I get to be
in charge of cups and ice?

127
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,977
All right.

128
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,715
Fine. I will be
in charge of cups and ice.

129
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,220
-I can get ice at the restaurant
-I got it!

130
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,491
-How did the audition go?
-Not so good.

131
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,465
Wait a minute.
Are you doing Joey's:

132
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,675
"The audition didn't go so well...
Yeah, it did"?

133
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,434
Yeah, I am!

134
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,776
-Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
-That's great!

135
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,853
I had to teach Ross my bit because
I actually didn't get a callback.

136
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,922
You got a callback too, didn't you?

137
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,852
Yeah, I did!

138
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,528
What are you doing out here?

139
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:03,036
It got kind of lonely up there,
so I thought I would come out here...

140
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,277
...and get some fresh air.

141
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,809
We're discussing the fall collection.

142
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,003
Oh, great.

143
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,273
Anyway, we really

144
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,684
-Sorry. We're smoking all over you.
-That's okay.

145
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,513
We'll move. You stay there.

146
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,449
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.

147
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,057
That's great!
You are the best!

148
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,389
Excuse me.
Can I bum one of those?

149
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,996
Actually, this one's...

150
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,363
What's so funny over here?

151
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,603
I thought you didn't smoke.

152
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:39,471
You know, I thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.

153
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,641
You know what I mean?
Doobies?

154
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,844
Actually, I thought to myself,
"Those guys are crazy!"

155
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,578
But no, I smoke the
regular ones all the time.

156
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,683
We get high.

157
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,989
Me too.

158
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,693
I'm kidding.

159
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,395
Me too.

160
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,665
Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?

161
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,001
Fortunately, I don't get
many callbacks, so...

162
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,407
Is it a good sign that
they asked us to wait?

163
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,239
Who knows?

164
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,183
We have narrowed it down
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...

165
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,687
...and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you.

166
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,087
Yes! I knew it!

167
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,097
Bye-bye.

168
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,124
So long.

169
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,098
Later.

170
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:42,206
I'm not married to him anymore.
He's my ex-husband. I'm totally gay!

171
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,742
This is great!
I might get to play Ben's dad.

172
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,401
Actually, that can't happen.

173
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,672
Because you have
such different looks...

174
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,850
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.

175
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,713
So it'll either be
you two or you two.

176
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,689
-This is gonna be kind of weird.
-Yeah, it is.

177
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,697
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

178
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,295
No. We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.

179
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,303
I thought we were just talking.

180
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,981
If Ben gets this commercial, do you
think you can get me some free soup?

181
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,085
Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.

182
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,317
Yeah, okay, but I have been supporting
a 29-year-old Italian for five years.

183
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,388
Is it okay if I leave this here
till Rachel's birthday party?

184
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,533
-Sure. What's in them?
-Cups.

185
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,735
Good, because we got Rachel
800 gallons of water.

186
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,873
That's a lot of cups.

187
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,409
I'm in charge of cups and ice.

188
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,037
And Monica's gonna rue the day
she put me in charge of cups and ice.

189
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,651
You know, I rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.

190
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,915
Okay, time to bring up
the rest of the cups.

191
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,566
Ross, I'm glad you're here.

192
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,100
-I want to talk to you.
-What's up?

193
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,933
I've been thinking about this
commercial thing. Me against Ben.

194
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,544
The two of us competing.
That can't lead to anything good.

195
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:33,578
I think I'm just gonna step aside.
I'll tell them that I won't audition.

196
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,850
Joey, that's great.
Thanks, man.

197
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,752
That's it?

198
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,066
You're gonna let me do this?
It's my career we're talking about!

199
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,225
But you just

200
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,031
I just said that
so you wouldn't let Ben do it.

201
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,474
If anyone should step aside,
it should be Ben.

202
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,302
-What?
-Chandler, tell him!

203
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,748
Well, let me get the door first.

204
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,416
Hi, no one!

205
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,587
Why should Ben step aside?

206
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,229
It was his audition in the
first place. You tagged along.

207
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,954
You're like the tagalong dad!

208
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,827
At least I care about his feelings.

209
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,390
What?

210
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,435
You know how hard it'll be on him
when he doesn't get it?

211
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,807
And why wouldn't he get it?

212
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,807
Come on!

213
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,839
Have you seen what my kid can do?

214
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,475
He dials phones,
he eats tortilla chips.

215
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,776
He plays soccer
with the cartoon tiger!

216
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,950
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?

217
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,853
You just give him a spoon, baby.

218
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,459
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!

219
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,654
This commercial belongs
to me and Mitch!

220
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,368
-Your kid's name is Raymond!
-Yeah? So is yours!

221
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,699
-How did work go?
-It was great.

222
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,037
I went down there like you said.
And we talked business.

223
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,803
And Kim took my opinions.

224
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,610
You stink!

225
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,850
-Thanks.
-No, I'm serious.

226
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,522
That's because I went down there
and they were smoking.

227
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,181
This is actually the smell of success.

228
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,051
But there's something different

229
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,989
Oh, my God! You smoked!

230
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,454
I did not.

231
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,965
Yes, you did. You look
happy and sick. You smoked!

232
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,140
All right, fine! But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.

233
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,142
I wish I had to smoke for my career.

234
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,076
But it's so gross!

235
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,076
It's not that bad, you know?

236
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:48,342
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
and my fingers sort of smell.

237
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,021
I actually feel like I could throw up.

238
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,087
-Can you hear yourself?
-I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

239
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,922
I'm not myself.
I smoked like half a pack.

240
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,894
I feel a little shaky and a little weird.

241
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,832
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.

242
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,570
You smell so smoky,
I gotta get up.

243
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,575
I'm not kidding.

244
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,907
I think you smell great.

245
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,214
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.

246
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,047
Absolutely.

247
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,350
I'm so onboard.

248
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,963
-Didn't you just light that?
-Yeah.

249
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,357
But you know what?

250
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,126
I'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.

251
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,028
Good luck, Rach.

252
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,037
I've been thinking about quitting.

253
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,809
Every Sunday night,
I tell myself I'm quitting.

254
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,036
Every Monday morning, it's like:

255
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,405
Tell me about it.

256
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,378
We'll just quit.
Let's all quit!

257
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
It sounds appealing.

258
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,849
-I never could do it.
-But you could. Absolutely.

259
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,024
We can help each other.
We could get those patches.

260
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,591
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

261
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,287
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit!

262
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,624
Great! Give me those cigs.
Come on!

263
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,960
Give it! Out. Done. Quit.

264
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,100
My late husband gave me that lighter.

265
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,376
I'm not kidding.

266
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,569
Okay, then.

267
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,308
Mmm...soup.

268
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,445
Mmm...soup.

269
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,120
Would you mind watching Ben for me
while I use the ladies' room?

270
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,490
-No problem.
-Thanks.

271
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,342
So you want to be an actor?
I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

272
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,947
There's tons of rejection.
No stability.

273
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,849
I mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

274
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,588
The next day, you're eating
ketchup out of the bottle.

275
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,696
It's a tough life. I mean, sure,
you can get up whenever you want...

276
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,957
...watch TV all day...

277
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,500
...meet tons of women in acting class...

278
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,996
Oh, who am I kidding. I can't
talk you out of this. It's a great life.

279
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,908
-Joey.
-Ross.

280
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,379
Ben.

281
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,016
I mean, Ben. Ben.

282
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,079
Raymond, Joey, you're up.

283
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,357
So here's what...

284
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,363
Are you sure that I haven't seen you
somewhere before?

285
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,366
No, I haven't been in any plays.

286
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,435
All right, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.

287
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,200
Is there a problem?

288
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,107
Well, this is noodle soup.
And I've been working with tomato.

289
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,874
But that's okay. No problem.

290
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
Mmm...noodle soup.

291
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,786
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mmm...soup."

292
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,881
-What'd I say?
-"Mmm...noodle soup."

293
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,284
How's that different?

294
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,269
All right. Let's try one.

295
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:30,866
Mmm...

296
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,044
...noodle soup.

297
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,380
Let's do it again.

298
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,718
Mmm...soup.

299
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,891
I mean, noodle soup.
I mean, soup!

300
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,048
Come on!

301
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,056
You know what?
We need to move on.

302
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,423
No, I could do it one more time.

303
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,658
Look.

304
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,130
Mmm...noodle soup.

305
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,669
Damn it!

306
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:08,073
So I think that if we get these samples
into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine.

307
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,772
Sounds good.
So, Rach, how you doing?

308
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,577
-I'm great!
-No, with the not-smoking thing.

309
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,518
Kill me now.

310
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,284
Let me tell you something,
I ate 40 Mallomars today.

311
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,987
I mean, I have patches
all over my body, you know?

312
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,327
-I mean, I haven't slept in two days.
-We quit yesterday.

313
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,996
That's counting today.

314
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,505
But anyway, so these samples, I think

315
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,107
Oh, my God!

316
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,736
I'm so sorry, I forgot. I have to go
to the mailroom and mail some proofs.

317
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,213
Go ahead. Rachel and I will just sit here
and keep brainstorming.

318
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,977
Also, Vogue called.
And they were wondering

319
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,988
You know what? I'm a little hungry. I'm just
gonna run down to the vending machines.

320
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,589
All right.

321
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,928
Busted!

322
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:11,239
Come on! What are you doing?
I thought we were the Patch Sisters.

323
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,068
That didn't work out.

324
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,571
Wait a minute.
What about all we've talked about?

325
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,114
You know, the disgusting place,
the ugly people.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,115
Hey, how you doing?

327
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,654
We tried to quit.
But it was too hard.

328
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,296
If you started smoking again,
you could have at least told me.

329
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,056
Give me one.
What are we talking about?

330
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,666
Don't you give up.

331
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,837
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we won't drag you down.

332
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,098
Wait. No, no.
Drag me down.

333
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,106
Forget it. We're so proud
of how well you're doing.

334
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,508
I won't let you blow it.
If I catch you, you're fired.

335
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,512
Go on, get out of here.
I don't want you breathing this stuff.

336
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,652
So, okay. You'll come with me
on the Paris trip?

337
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,686
Oh, man!

338
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,957
Check it out.
Cup hat, cup banner...

339
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,999
...cup chandelier, and the thing
that started it all: the cup!

340
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,365
Great job with the cups.

341
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,467
Why don't you just go out with her?

342
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,307
Did you notice the ice? Look!

343
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:26,007
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.

344
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,985
Mystical.

345
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,359
No one's eating my food.
They're eating her snow cones!

346
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,461
There are snow cones?

347
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,200
-Go, go!
-Thank you.

348
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,503
-You really did do a nice job.
-Thank you...

349
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,579
...for stating the obvious.

350
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,547
I deserve that.

351
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,448
I just want you to know that if we ever
cohost a party together again...

352
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,613
-...you can do whatever you want.
-Joey's got a birthday coming up.

353
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,887
-Really? What do you wanna do?
-Okay, I'd like to be in charge of beer.

354
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,530
Well, then there's nothing left for me.

355
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,527
-Look, look!
-Surprise!

356
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,399
What? My birthday is not
for another month.

357
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,934
That's the surprise.

358
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:29,072
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so great! It's so unexpected.

359
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,546
I mean, Chandler's birthday
is even before mine.

360
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,782
Surprise!

361
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,620
This is so great!
Look at all these...

362
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,785
...cups.

363
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,932
This is so weird.

364
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,298
I was in charge of cups.

365
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,560
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

366
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,907
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

367
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,878
-What's in your hand?
-Money. I'm stealing all the money.

368
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,715
Chandler.

369
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,716
But just one, okay? Because nobody
knows when my birthday is.

370
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,985
Let me make this clear to you, okay?

371
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,751
It's either that...

372
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,656
...or this.

373
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,127
They were menthol.

374
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,309
Listen, man. I'm sorry
the audition didn't go well.

375
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:38,872
Yeah, right.

376
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,347
No, really. I am, Joey.
I feel bad.

377
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,682
Look, Ross.
You don't have to, okay?

378
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,019
It's not your fault I suck.

379
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,855
What kind of an actor can't even say,
"Mmm...noodle soup"?

380
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,234
You know what? Maybe you didn't
mess up your audition because you suck.

381
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,500
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.

382
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,001
What do you mean?

383
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,504
I think, subconsciously

384
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,273
You lost me.

385
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,557
I think, on some level,
you sabotaged...

386
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,852
...your own audition
so Ben would get the part.

387
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,031
Your way sounds
a lot better than mine.

388
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,599
It's not that I'm a bad actor.

389
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:39,567
No, it's just that I care
so damn much about little Ben...

390
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,077
...that it was more important
for me to see him succeed.

391
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,806
-There you go. Thank you.
-Thank you.

392
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,914
-So did he get it?
-No.

393
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,416
What are you gonna do?

394
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,992
Is Rachel Green here?
I'm meeting her for lunch.

395
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,165
She doesn't come down anymore.
You'll find her on 10.

396
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,856
Okay, great.

397
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,797
So we talked
about the presentation.

398
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,699
He wondered if one person
would be enough.

399
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,135
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

400
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,080
I'll catch you guys later.
