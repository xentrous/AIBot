1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,000
-Hi!
-Hey!

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,440
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400
About twenty. Couple people
from work had something else to do.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,440
Your sisters called and can't make it.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,200
What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event..

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,440
where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,480
I don't care, as long as my mom's here.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,480
-Oh, my God. Your mother.
-What? My mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,120
Well, given that we forgot to invite her,
it would be a big coincidence if she was.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,480
My God!

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,320
Phoebe was in charge
of the invitations.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,080
I don't have a mother.
So often I forget..

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,560
Oh, give it a rest.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,840
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,320
No.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,480
Neither is mine.

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,960
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,480
Make sure she comes.
It's important. It's my mom.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,680
-I know. What's her number?
-I don't know.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,720
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,880
If you're in charge of invitations,
why am I calling her?

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Hello, Mrs. Green!
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,800
-Oh, hello, Monica.
-Hi.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
It's last-minute, but we've decided
to throw an impromptu..

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,680
-baby shower for Rachel today.
-My daughters told me..

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,280
when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,920
-Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-For what, dear?

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,000
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,120
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm sorry for everything.
Really, I mean..

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,800
there's a lot of planning
in a baby shower.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,520
You know, things get
overlooked and..

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
Phoebe's mother killed herself.

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,120
Why? Did you forget
to invite her too?

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,160
Oh, you're so funny.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,400
Please, please, can you come?
It starts at 4:00.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,880
-Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.
-Thank you.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,600
-Isn't it at 3?
-Son of a bitch!

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,240
Hey, Joe! Wanna shoot some hoops?

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,120
And for the record, I am not
covering the tall one this time.

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,800
Fine, but she's not that tall.

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,440
I can't go. I'm practicing. I got an audition
to be the host of a new game show.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
-Cool!
-Great!

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,880
If I get it, by day
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

45
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,920
But by night I'll be Joey Tribbiani!

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,880
You'll be perfect for this!
That's already your name!

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,240
I know. I know.

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,880
It'd be great if I got this because you
never know what could happen on a soap.

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,880
But I could be
a game-show host forever.

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Like that Bob Barker guy. He's been
doing The Price is Right for 75 years.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,600
I bet the ratings weren't good
for the first 25.

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
You know, before there was television.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,720
But the problem,
this game is really complicated.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,520
Come on. You said the same thing
about Hungry Hungry Hippos.

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,440
And last week, you beat Ben.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Yeah. I have to be
honest with you guys.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,480
He kind of let me win.

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
The audition's in a couple hours,
and I don't understand the game.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,840
Do you want some help?

60
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,960
We can lose to junior-high girls
some other time.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,240
All right. Let's play Bamboozled!

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,280
-Bamboozled?
-Yeah. Isn't that a cool name?

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
-Yeah!
-No!

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
All right. Okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,240
Tell us about yourself, Ross.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,920
Well, I'm a paleontologist.
I live in New York.

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,760
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And..

69
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
I said, a little bit, Ross.
How about you, Chandler?

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
I'm a headhunter. I hook up
out-of-work Soviet scientists..

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,600
with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,320
Excellent! Let's play!
Chandler, you'll go first.

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,200
-What is the capital of Colombia?
-Bogota.

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,360
It's Bogota, but close enough.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,800
-What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
-I should know that.

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's see. One moment, please..

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,360
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines if you go higher or lower.

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,760
Higher or lower than what?

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,040
-This is embarrassing!
-Can you believe how lame this is?

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,720
I told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,040
You ordered a stripper for the shower?
That is inappropriate.

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,920
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

85
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,560
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Try.

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,840
There's my little girl!

89
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,560
-She's still mad.
-Yeah, I know.

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,800
Isn't it great? One less
person to make small talk with.

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
Hey, how are you?

92
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

93
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,560
We've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,360
You hate it when people
are mad at you..

96
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
but you just have
to be okay with it.

97
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Okay. I can do that.

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,200
-I gotta go powder my ass.
-Oh.

99
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,360
Look at that face! Just like when
you were in high school.

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,760
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were a cheerleader in trouble.

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,560
-Come, let's get some tea.
-Okay.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,760
Oh, my! Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

103
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,480
Did you pick a nanny? If you use your
housekeeper, it will split her focus.

104
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,080
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And I don't have a housekeeper.

105
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,160
It's like you're a cave person.

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,800
You must get a nanny. You don't
know how overwhelming it will be.

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,120
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.

108
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

109
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,000
I actually think
I remember some of it.

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,800
Tu madre esta loca.

111
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
Such a sweet woman.

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,520
And more important,
she became a part of our family.

113
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,680
That's right, Mrs. K.
What did that K stand for?

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
I have no idea, dear.
She was the nanny.

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,560
As great as she was,
I can't afford that.

116
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget
not everyone has alimony.

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
-Oh, Rachel!
-What?

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,400
I just had a great idea!
I'm gonna come live with you!

119
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,960
What? What?

120
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,120
Look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

122
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,280
Yes, yes, I do.

123
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,280
Ross, you're in the lead.

124
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,640
Would you like to take another question
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

125
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,400
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey.

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
I'll take another question.

127
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Okay. This is gonna be tough.
Hold your breath.

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,480
It's okay. I'm ready.

129
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,520
You gotta hold your breath
until you answer.

130
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,560
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his..

131
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Okay. What do you have a fear of if
you suffer from this phobia? Triska..

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,960
Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk..

133
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
Look at this. How do you say that?

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,640
-Let me see that.
-This one right here.

135
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,360
-Triskaidekaphobia.
-Fear of Triscuits!

136
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,720
-No! No. Fear of the number 13.
-Fear of Triscuits?

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,240
It's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,960
Chandler, you're up.

139
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass
for a free turn.

140
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,600
Yes, yes. But you can only use
it once, so choose wisely.

141
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
This is tricky.

142
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,440
I mean, I am in the lead, but I would
love another shot at the Golden Monkey.

143
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,720
-This game makes no sense!
-You're upset because you're losing.

144
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,680
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,120
I would like to hang
on to my Angel Pass please.

146
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,000
You can either spin the Wheel
or pick a Google Card.

147
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,600
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, I don't care.

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,120
You must choose.

149
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,480
-Either. It makes no difference.
-Choose, you jackass.

150
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,600
-I'll take a card.
-You picked the Gimme Card!

151
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
-You get all of Ross' points!
-What?

152
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,320
This game is kind of fun!

153
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,520
You don't think it's crazy that
you get my points..?

154
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
The contestants aren't supposed
to speak to each other.

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Now, do you wanna start
opening presents..

156
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,920
because it seems like people
are getting itchy to leave.

157
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
And when I say people,
I mean me.

158
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,320
-Why did you invite my mother?
-What?

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,680
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.

160
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,120
-For how long?
-Eight weeks.

161
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,680
I love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

162
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
I'd be honored if she wanted
to live with me.

163
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,360
She can't hear you.

164
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,080
What am I gonna do?

165
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,960
If you don't want her to move
in with you, just tell her.

166
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
You're right.
I'm about to have a baby.

167
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,200
I can say I don't want
her sleeping on my couch.

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,520
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.
This can't happen.

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
That is right.

170
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,760
Tell her you don't want her
to live with you.

171
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,200
Do not take no for an answer.

172
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,560
This is great! Now she's
gonna be mad at Rachel!

173
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,640
And I'm just gonna swoop in there and
be like the daughter she never had.

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Oh, honey, you have
to let it go.

175
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,040
Okay.

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Who doesn't accept an apology?

177
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,400
I mean, it's just so simple.

178
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,720
"I'm sorry, Sandra."
"That's okay, Monica.

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,000
I forgive you.

180
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,920
And by the way, you're very pretty."

181
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
I have new respect for Chandler.

182
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,440
All right, everybody!
It's time to open the presents!

183
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes! The first gift
that Rachel opens..

184
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,000
should be from the grandmother.

185
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,840
Because you're the most important
person in this room! And in the world!

186
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,280
I don't have a gift because I wasn't
invited until the last minute.

187
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,240
But thank you so much, dear, for
bringing that to everybody's attention.

188
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,560
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents!

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,200
-It's okay that you didn't get a gift.
-I kind of did.

190
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,680
Me! Eight weeks of me.

191
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Okay. See, Mom,
the truth is, I can do this on my own.

192
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,320
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

193
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,320
But you need help at the beginning.

194
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
I know what I'm doing.
I can handle it.

195
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,960
Really? Remember Twinkles?

196
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,960
He was a hamster.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

197
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time!

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
You're the glue holding
this party together.

199
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,680
It's kind of falling apart here.

200
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,960
-Oh, look!
-Wow!

201
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,920
This is from your friends at work.

202
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,440
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
Oh, I know what this is.

203
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Wait a minute.

204
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,360
That can't be right.

205
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,000
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

206
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
Darling, that's a breast pump.

207
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,840
Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

208
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,480
Oh, wow! What's this?

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,960
-It's a Diaper Genie.
-It dispenses clean diapers!

210
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
It's where you put dirty ones.

211
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Why don't you take it outside
and throw it in a dumpster?

212
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,160
-You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
-What, it goes 10 times a day?

213
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,760
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

214
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,960
No, dear. That's what babies do.

215
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,360
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

216
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,040
What will you do with the baby
while you trot out to the garbage?

217
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,040
I don't know,
I'd leave it on the changing table?

218
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,080
-What? What did I do? What did I do?
-You can't leave a baby alone.

219
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,880
Of course, I know that!

220
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,800
Of course you never leave
a baby alone.

221
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,320
It would..
She wouldn't be safe.

222
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
Not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy.

223
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,320
Opening the presents is a little
overwhelming right now.

224
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm gonna maybe open
them all a little bit later.

225
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,360
Thank you for coming,
for the gifts..

226
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,800
-and this basket is beautiful.
-It's actually a bassinet.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,040
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

228
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,840
In what film would you hear this line:
"We don't need no stinking badges!"

229
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,840
-Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
-Correct! Backwards Bonus.

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
-Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
-Yes!

231
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
What? There's extra points for that?

232
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,160
Fair not that's!

233
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,520
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance
to the Golden Mud Hut!

234
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,920
-Wise choice. How many rungs?
-Six!

235
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,320
-That noise can only mean one thing.
-Hungry Monkey!

236
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,520
-I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
-It's an audio question.

237
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
Name this television theme song:

238
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,600
Oh, my God. I know this.
Give me a second.

239
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,760
-Tell it to the Time Turtle!
-Shut up!

240
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,960
-"I Dream of Jeannie"!
-Yes! Back in the lead!

241
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,320
I'd like to spin the Wheel.

242
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,600
Oh, come on!

243
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
Super Speedy Speed Round.

244
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,240
-Is there a Hopping Bonus?
-Of course.

245
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,680
-Who invented bifocals?
-Ben Franklin!

246
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Correct. Which monarch ruled
Great Britain the longest?

247
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
Queen Victoria!

248
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,240
You forgot to switch legs between
questions. No Hopping Bonus!

249
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,520
Every time!

250
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,520
-Yeah. Now over to Chandler.
-I'd like a Google Card.

251
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,200
-Are you sure?
-Yes! No! Google!

252
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,320
Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross!
Because, Chandler..

253
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,560
-you've been Bamboozled!
-No!

254
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,920
-Yes!
-This is the best game ever!

255
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,000
You'll stay as long as I need you?

256
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
-Of course.
-I swear I'm not an idiot.

257
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,760
I read books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,080
I didn't think to read about what
to do when the baby comes.

259
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,880
And the baby's coming..

260
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,920
and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

261
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,040
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

262
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,320
-Where you going?
-I'm going to the bathroom.

263
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,120
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

264
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,040
It is gonna be okay!

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,080
Worth a shot.

266
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,640
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

267
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,240
I just Bamboozled Chandler!

268
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,440
Which is not a sexual thing.

269
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,320
-Well, that was a quick shower.
-Not if you were here.

270
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,600
Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,440
We did. My mom got
us the greatest gift of all.

272
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,520
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

273
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,560
No. She's going to live
with us for eight weeks.

274
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,160
What?

275
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes! She's gonna help us
take care of the baby!

276
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
You're not serious!

277
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,120
She's a very nice woman,
but we can't take eight weeks of her.

278
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,400
-She'll drive us crazy..
-Hi, Ross!

279
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,680
Hey, roomie!

280
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,440
Hey, I'm Ray.
I'm the producer of the show.

281
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

282
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,880
This is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help with the audition.

283
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,920
-Right, Ray.
-Whenever you're ready.

284
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,480
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!

285
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,120
Erin, first question. In hockey,
who is known as "The Great One"?

286
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,480
-Gretzky.
-Correct!

287
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,400
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel?

288
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,680
Didn't your agents give
you the revised rules?

289
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,800
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

290
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,840
Why?

291
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
It was too complicated.
People didn't follow it.

292
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,040
Complicated?! Spin the Wheel
to go up the Ladder of Chance..

293
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,400
through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.

294
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,600
You yank his tail,
and you're in Paradise Pond!

295
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,320
Yeah. All that's gone.

296
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,480
It's a simple
question-and-answer game now.

297
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,760
Well, what's fun about that?

298
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,240
You expect me to host a boring game
of people answering questions?

299
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,120
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.

300
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,120
Let's play Bamboozled!

301
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,320
So I thought we'd put the
changing station in the living room.

302
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,760
I thought I'd bring in my decorator
because I feel like I'm at my best..

303
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,800
when surrounded by jewel tones.

304
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
Sure, who doesn't?

305
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,800
Oh, and all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have..

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,120
they might be more at home
in the garage.

307
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,560
-Well, we don't have a garage.
-Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

308
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,480
You know what? Maybe it's not
absolutely vital that you live with us.

309
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,960
-Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
-I really do. I don't know anything.

310
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,920
I'm sure that's not true.

311
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,840
Oh, no?
Do I know anything about babies?

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,960
-No. Not a thing.
-It's frightening.

313
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,120
Even if she doesn't
know anything, I do.

314
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,320
And I'll be there to show her.

315
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,520
That's exactly what
Rachel's father told me.

316
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Know what he said
at the first 3 a.m. feeding?

317
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,120
"I'm tired. You take care of it."

318
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,840
Which I later said to him
when he wanted to have sex.

319
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,880
Well, I'm not Rachel's dad.

320
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
And no offense,
but he's an ass.

321
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,680
I do like you, Ross.

322
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,520
I have a son. His mother
and I didn't live together.

323
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,040
When he was with me, I took
care of him all the time, by myself.

324
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,240
-That's true. You do have another child.
-Yeah.

325
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,120
With another woman.

326
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,520
Have you no control, Ross?

327
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
That's a different issue.

328
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,000
The point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her..

329
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,400
and bathe her and change her.

330
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,760
I want to do all those things.

331
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,360
-You don't need me to live with you.
-Yes!

332
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,360
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

333
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,680
-You'll be a great father.
-You'll be a wonderful grandma.

334
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,840
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing!

335
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,240
Every first-time mother
feels that way.

336
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,160
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city..

337
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,440
you were a spoiled, helpless little
girl who used Daddy's credit cards!

338
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,480
I hope you're going
somewhere with this.

339
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,360
Look at you.
You're this big executive.

340
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,200
You are more capable
than you give yourself credit for.

341
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,360
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

342
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
-Really?
-I'm telling you.

343
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Thank you.

344
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,880
All right. I'm gonna get going.

345
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
No, sweetheart, stay put.

346
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,400
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm
not here. Which I almost wasn't.

347
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

348
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,480
Nothing. You have apologized
to her, like, a million times.

349
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,600
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

350
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,880
You just threw her daughter a lovely,
albeit slightly boring, shower.

351
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,920
-And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
-You know what? You're right.

352
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
If you wanna say anything,
I'd tell her off.

353
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,720
Really?

354
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,320
Okay, I will.

355
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,720
Mrs. Green?

356
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Mrs. Green?

357
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,360
It is rude to leave a party without saying
goodbye to the host.

358
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,160
When someone apologizes to you,
the decent thing to do is to accept it.

359
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
What I did wasn't on purpose.

360
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,200
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

361
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,680
-Spiteful?
-That's right.

362
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,640
It's time you took a good
look in the mirror, young lady!

363
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,440
Old lady!

364
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,360
Lady!

365
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,320
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

366
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,000
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you.

367
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,400
Good day.

368
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,080
I can't feel my legs!

369
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,640
You were fantastic!
I'm so proud of you.

370
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,680
-Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
-You should be.

371
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,160
-Could you get me something to drink?
-You got it!

372
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,000
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!
I apologize. If you..

373
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
Okay! I bit my tongue!

374
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,840
But I'm still really sorry!

375
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
-Okay, I'm ready.
-You sure?

376
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,560
I've done my studying,
and I know my stuff.

377
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,840
All right, then.

378
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,960
Rachel Green,
let's play Bamboozled!

379
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,200
How do you test the temperature
of the baby's bath water?

380
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
-Put your elbow in it.
-Excellent!

381
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,600
-How do you put a baby down for a nap?
-Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.

382
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,960
Correct!

383
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,040
There's a hopping bonus here,
but I don't suggest you take it.

384
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,560
Okay.

385
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,480
This is an audio question. What do
you do when a baby makes this sound:

386
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.

387
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Excellent! Now do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

388
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
-A card! A card! I pick a card!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

389
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,800
You've been Bamboozled!
You're gonna be a terrible mother!

390
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,280
I've lost sight of why we're doing this!

391
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,760
Please don't walk away.

392
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
I've gone too far.
