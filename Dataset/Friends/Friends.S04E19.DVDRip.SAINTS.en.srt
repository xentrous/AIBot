1
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:11,200
Morning's here

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,772
The morning's here

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,047
Sunshine is here

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,081
The sky is clear

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,581
The morning's here

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,549
The morning's here

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,120
Hey!

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,385
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

9
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,261
Oh, come on!

10
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,192
Morning's here!

11
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,204
I hate this apartment!

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,878
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,783
I hate that singing guy!

14
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,651
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,960
Morning's here

16
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,390
Stop it!

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,294
I will kill you.

18
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,462
I hate that my room is so small.

19
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,368
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.

20
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,477
You don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

21
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,679
I am tired of your bellyaching.

22
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,011
I've worked hard to make this
a nice place for us.

23
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,485
I know.
I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,316
I'm sorry, okay?

25
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,021
It's a great apartment!

26
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,057
Shut up!
This place is a hole!

27
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,824
The One with All the Haste

28
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,441
I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,620
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

30
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,115
He does that?

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,951
I don't know. Whatever.

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,590
I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

33
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,286
Oh, I know.

34
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,826
You know what?

35
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,868
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

36
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,504
When I'm with you, I'm like...

37
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,505
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

38
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,836
I mean, I love you too.
A lot.

39
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,241
But that guy!

40
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,710
I love that guy!

41
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,780
I love both of you.

42
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,014
I wish I didn't have to go.

43
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,120
Then don't.

44
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,988
Stay here.
Don't go so soon to London.

45
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,754
Just one more day.

46
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,955
Please don't do this to me again.

47
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,797
I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

48
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,064
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

49
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,635
I wish I could.

50
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,806
Oh, no. Don't start packing.

51
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,072
Come on!

52
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,320
I don't think you understand packing.

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:48,153
I don't want to leave it till last.
Last time, I left my knickers here.

54
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,329
Yeah, I know.
I tried them on.

55
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,330
You didn't!

56
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,001
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

57
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,872
Excuse me?

58
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,677
Your pants.

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,854
Oh yeah! You like them?

60
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,689
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

61
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,360
These are so comfortable.

62
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,761
Pheebs, those are Santa pants.

63
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,194
Santa pants.

64
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,904
Santa Claus' pants.

65
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,674
No. They're maternity pants.

66
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,278
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

67
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,244
These names are good,
and these are bad.

68
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,452
Hey, Phoebes.

69
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,794
So, how are the elves?

70
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,764
I don't know.
How are the...you know?

71
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,104
Your clothes aren't funny.

72
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,435
What should I wear to a Knicks game?

73
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,469
A T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

74
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,772
You have tickets?

75
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,214
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

76
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,581
Apparently, they're good seats.

77
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,222
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

78
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,451
I could slip Woody Allen my resume.

79
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,289
Do you guys want these?

80
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,863
Yeah, we do!

81
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,693
Well, you got them!

82
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,100
Just give us our apartment back.

83
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,175
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

84
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,100
Are you serious?

85
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:50,009
Come on.
We know what these are worth.

86
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,308
Do you think we're stupid?

87
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,849
Not stupid.
You're meaner than I thought.

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,678
What do you say?

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:02,453
Forget it. I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

90
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,788
Your "bachelor pad"?

91
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,222
Have you even had a girl here?

92
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,591
No.

93
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,665
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning.

94
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,643
Yeah, you do!

95
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,152
Come on!

96
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,685
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

97
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,319
Good one.

98
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,151
Come on.
Season tickets!

99
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,522
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,721
I'm not giving up the apartment.

101
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,665
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

102
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,601
...to the No. 1 salesman
every year. My dad never won.

103
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:53,076
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

104
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,745
Hey guys!

105
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,942
Oh, my God!

106
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,684
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

107
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,258
Oh, yeah.
Emily convinced me to do it.

108
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,692
You do know that Wham broke up?

109
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,963
I like it. Emily likes it.
That's what counts.

110
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,197
So, how are you guys doing?

111
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,864
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

112
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,309
Where's Emily?

113
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,644
She's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

114
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,372
Didn't she, like, just get here?

115
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,878
Easy, tiger.

116
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,385
I just hate this so much.

117
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,548
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

118
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,663
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

119
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,332
-So what'll you do?
-There's nothing to do.

120
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,399
She lives there.
I live here.

121
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,833
She'd have to move here.

122
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,967
She should move here.

123
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,797
What?

124
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,577
-I can ask her to live with me.
-Are you serious?

125
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,077
-I mean, why not?
-You've only known her six weeks!

126
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,241
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

127
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,480
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like...

128
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,154
She brings out this great side of me.

129
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,063
I mean, I love her, you know?

130
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,255
And I love the milk!

131
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,432
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

132
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,966
Joey, you say things now.

133
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,276
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

134
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,704
She's great!

135
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,679
But this is too soon.
You'll only scare her.

136
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,985
I don't want to do that.

137
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,351
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

138
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,055
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

139
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,158
I'm not going to do it.

140
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,822
-Thanks guys.
-No problem.

141
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,864
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,012
It's too hard. Too hard!

143
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,142
All right.
Last chance for the tickets.

144
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,914
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

145
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,158
No, thank you.

146
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,690
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

147
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,991
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

148
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,396
I want those seats. But we can't live
in the small apartment...

149
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,576
...after living here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?

150
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,576
Ever read Sports Illustrated?

151
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,447
No, I didn't read yours!

152
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,412
We can go to the game tonight!

153
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,884
The only way I'll consider this is...

154
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,580
...if they offer more
than just season seats.

155
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,258
-It's the Knicks!
-Screw the Knicks!

156
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,093
I didn't mean that.
I just meant that...

157
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,271
...the apartment is worth
so much more.

158
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,436
And the Knicks rule.

159
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,975
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

160
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,377
So? Are you going to do it?

161
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,880
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

162
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,142
All right, look.

163
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,381
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

164
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,615
Done!

165
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,725
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

166
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,157
We could get nothing.

167
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,660
Or everything.

168
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,298
I like that.

169
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,993
What do you say?

170
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,960
Just do it!

171
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,730
Oh! I'm convinced!

172
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,971
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

173
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,645
Because you're my best friend.

174
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,418
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

175
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,944
I'm in.

176
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,950
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

177
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,286
We should let Phoebe decide...

178
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,522
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

179
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,829
I have a game!

180
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,931
-This is great!
-What's the game?

181
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,199
It doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

182
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,171
No, it doesn't have a name.

183
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,848
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

184
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,321
-They're green?
-Good! Five points!

185
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,796
Same question.

186
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,331
-They're tall.
-Three points!

187
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,469
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

188
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,146
That's not even a game.

189
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,409
Shut up. We're winning!

190
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,746
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

191
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,685
High card wins.
What do you say?

192
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,156
-Let's do it!
-Oh, I have cards!

193
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,828
Yeah. Here.

194
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,894
No, these are the trick deck.

195
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,590
Here, yes.

196
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,500
Okay, you guys pick first.

197
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,742
-Four.
-That's a low one!

198
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,605
You look.
I can't do it.

199
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,851
What makes you think I can?

200
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,576
Ace!

201
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,458
Why are you hugging?

202
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,184
We won our apartment back!

203
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,727
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

204
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,628
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

205
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,773
I don't know.

206
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,540
Look it!

207
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,313
Come on, pick again!

208
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,452
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

209
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,822
I know queen is high!

210
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,733
Not as high as...

211
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,731
It worked! King!

212
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,332
We pick again!
We pick again!

213
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,098
-Why?
-I don't know.

214
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,445
Tickets, please.

215
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,808
Courtside, baby!

216
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,749
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

217
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,953
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

218
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,090
No, they didn't.

219
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,503
Packed while you were gone.

220
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,106
I left knickers under your pillow.

221
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,604
Move in with me?

222
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,337
What?

223
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,282
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

224
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:20,288
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

225
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,489
I don't know.

226
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,061
Leaving London...

227
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,302
My whole family lives there...

228
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,300
-My job.
-You'll get a job here.

229
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,566
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

230
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,675
That could be you.

231
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,206
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

232
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,345
You come to England.

233
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,542
I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

234
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,712
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

235
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,718
I don't think so.

236
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,759
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

237
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,399
...and we were getting married.

238
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,590
What?

239
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:09,504
Right. I shouldn't have said "married."
Please don't go freaky on me.

240
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,037
I didn't mean it.
I take it back.

241
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,576
No. Don't.

242
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,005
Why don't we?

243
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,446
Why don't we what?

244
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,515
Get married.

245
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,014
You are mad!

246
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:32,027
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

247
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,392
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

248
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,159
-We've known each other six weeks!
-I know.

249
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,033
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

250
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,404
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

251
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,911
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

252
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,942
I mean, this...

253
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,986
This makes sense for us.

254
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,921
Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

255
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,188
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Me!

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,490
This feels right.

257
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,325
Doesn't it?

258
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,504
My parents will be really mad.

259
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,401
Are you saying, "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

260
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,167
Yes.

261
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,912
-We're getting married!
-Oh, my God!

262
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,977
We're getting married!

263
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,689
Come here, come here.

264
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,601
Emily, will you marry me?

265
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,175
It's a bit small.

266
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,381
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

267
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,948
It was.

268
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,300
Those were, like,
the best seats ever!

269
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,063
Should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

270
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,536
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

271
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,579
Oh, God!

272
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,622
Hey, you want a beer?

273
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,656
I know!

274
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,160
Open up! Open up! Open up!

275
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,663
We'll discuss it in the morning.

276
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,338
What the hell is going on?

277
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,012
We took our apartment back!

278
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,316
I had nothing to do with it.

279
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,255
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

280
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,029
We are switching back right now.

281
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,268
No, we're not.
We're not leaving!

282
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,532
You'll have to.
You both have jobs.

283
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,233
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.

284
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,036
-Right, Joe?
-I don't know.

285
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,144
What?

286
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,053
I don't want to move again, with...

287
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,955
This is our apartment
and they stole

288
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,992
You stole!

289
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,556
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

290
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,668
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

291
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,061
All right.

292
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,968
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

293
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,181
No more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

294
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,714
-Let us keep the apartment and
-As a thank you...

295
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,991
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

296
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,731
-Totally worth it!
-That was one good minute!

297
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:28,991
Good night.

298
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,503
-Men are such idiots.
-I know.

299
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:42,339
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

300
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,779
If you had just done that
after the last contest...

301
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,213
...no one would have
had to move at all.

302
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,753
Let's pretend that's not true.

303
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,552
Scarf's done.

304
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,799
Come on, come on!

305
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,128
What's going on?

306
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,035
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

307
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,638
Emily and I, we decided...

308
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,144
...to get married.

309
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,646
What?

310
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,454
Oh, are you pregnant too?

311
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,551
No.

312
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,960
When did
How did you

313
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,298
We just decided to go for it.

314
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,833
We know it's a bit hasty...

315
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,932
...but it just feels so right.

316
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,838
I was just telling the guys

317
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,106
Yeah, I heard.

318
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,020
I think it's great!

319
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,323
I'm so happy for you!

320
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,460
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!

321
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,637
I can't believe
you're getting married!

322
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,702
Monica and Rachel made out.

323
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,685
Morning's here

324
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,417
The morning's here

325
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,494
Sunshine is here

326
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,927
The sky is clear

327
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,901
The morning's here

328
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,072
-Hey, you're back!
-Hey, get into gear

329
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,437
Breakfast is near

330
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:55,739
The dark of night has disappeared

331
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,812
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
