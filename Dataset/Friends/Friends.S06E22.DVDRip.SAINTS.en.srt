1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,463
Hi, you guys.

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,194
What's the matter?

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,398
Well, it's just.. It's one of these
situations that I just hate.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,077
A massage client gave
me three tickets...

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,940
to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,808
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,579
No. No. It's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,983
-I'll give up my ticket.
-Me too.

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,324
Okay. That's so generous.

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,757
And I think Ross is generous too.

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,932
Great! Then it's just us girls.

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,566
-Great.
-Yeah.

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,360
So what is the exhibit?

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,198
It's mostly just photographs...

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:45,367
of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,311
Oh, man!

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,250
-Hi.
-Hi.

18
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,548
Hey, Ross, listen.

19
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,887
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:08,459
Thanks, but I have plans.
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:09,999
-That's great!
-Yeah.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,434
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.

23
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,628
Why? What?

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,741
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,077
That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,249
You know, let it go. Stop it!

27
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,377
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father...

28
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,487
so he's much older than she is.

29
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,985
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils.

30
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,396
All that does is remind us
that you're interested in fossils.

31
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,362
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,563
Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear.

33
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,279
-Ross?
-Come on! That's funny.

34
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,177
Because he's gonna..
He's got, like, a hearing aid.

35
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,878
Because he's all old.

36
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,353
One second.

37
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,858
Okay, look, Ross.

38
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,658
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

39
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,236
I've accepted the fact
that you're dating her.

40
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,066
Really? That's great.

41
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,499
Yeah, but then I changed my mind.

42
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,409
I'm funny like that.

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,945
So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you.

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,617
I don't want you
seeing my daughter anymore.

45
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,116
Look, I realize it upsets you.

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,049
Yes, it does.

47
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,684
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

48
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,728
so I don't think there's
anything you can do about it.

49
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,765
I'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.

50
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,196
Oh, a man with a plan!

51
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,367
The One Where Paul's The Man

52
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,779
This is so exciting. You can get your
picture back up on the wall of fame.

53
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,812
He's got all the big actors.

54
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,315
It was so cool when I was up there.

55
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,943
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

56
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,622
I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

57
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,294
Now he's just laughing at me.

58
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,363
Look at him.
That smug Belushi bastard!

59
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,860
Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...

60
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,902
they could put you by Matt Lauer.

61
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,540
Look at him just smiling at me.

62
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,410
Yeah, I know.
We'd be great together.

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,118
-So I'm back.
-Who are you?

64
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,553
Joey Tribbiani.

65
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,422
From the wall?

66
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,062
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory.

67
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,122
Okay, anyway.

68
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,065
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

69
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,537
-Show me in the TV book.
-It's not on TV yet.

70
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,541
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

71
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,040
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.

72
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,153
So, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes?

73
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,653
Maybe? Just ones that
haven't been cleaned yet?

74
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,122
God.

75
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,262
I love museums.

76
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,764
-Soaking up all the culture.
-Yeah.

77
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,699
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!

78
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,733
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but I can't eat too much.

79
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,242
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

80
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,710
Do you think maybe
he's gonna tell you he's gay?

81
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,316
What? No, why?

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,183
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

83
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,459
You could put the aisle over here and
have the wedding ceremony over here.

84
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,629
I didn't know you
could get married here.

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,128
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

86
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,894
But I wouldn't put the aisle there. And
I would never have the ceremony there.

87
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,197
You'd have the ceremony
under a beautiful arch.

88
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,299
May I help you?

89
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,767
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's just such a beautiful space.

90
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,412
-Do you do a lot of weddings?
-Yes, we're popular.

91
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,343
There's a two-year waiting list.
Sorry.

92
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,844
Monica, you should put
your name down for this place.

93
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,782
What? Are you crazy?

94
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,919
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

95
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,489
But there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

96
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,886
Then you've got to wait
another two years?

97
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,862
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

98
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,035
He's gonna find somebody else.

99
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,636
Someone who did put their name
on the list.

100
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,036
It can't hurt to put your name down.

101
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,939
If, in two years, you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

102
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,013
I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

103
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,815
I'm gonna do it too.

104
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,006
Me too!

105
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,554
-Really? Who would you marry?
-I don't have anyone right now.

106
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,815
Oh, Phoebe.

107
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,485
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

108
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,162
Phoebe, that's not..

109
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,266
Don't even get me started on yours.

110
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,605
-Did you watch the tape of my show?
-I did.

111
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,538
-Let's get me back up there.
-You don't go up on the wall.

112
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,909
-What? But you saw the show.
-It was very offensive to my people.

113
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,513
Dry cleaners?

114
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,556
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

115
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,160
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!

116
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,661
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

117
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,129
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring nothing!

118
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,900
Okay, that may be true.

119
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,301
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!

120
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,943
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

121
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,705
-I've never seen it.
-You should. It's great!

122
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,546
This place is really beautiful.

123
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,658
I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,091
The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes.

125
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,192
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

126
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,233
But people say that my eyes look...

127
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,060
Do you wanna make out?

128
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,795
Sure.

129
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,005
Are you okay?

130
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,672
What's wrong?

131
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,213
Yeah. I was just thinking
about your father.

132
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,044
Well, whatever works for you.

133
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,742
No.

134
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,487
He just really freaked me out before.

135
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,993
So we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

136
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,255
Big deal.

137
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,558
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

138
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,092
Yeah.

139
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,798
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?

140
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,671
Why, are there, like,
bears or something?

141
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,044
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That.. That I forgot.

142
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,258
I can't believe I brought two cans
of bug spray and forgot that.

143
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,060
-I'll run to the store and get some.
-I'm the guy. I'll get it.

144
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,859
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.

145
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,434
Do you wanna ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

146
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,062
A little bit.

147
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,674
I'll be back in 10 minutes. Get in
the hot tub and I'll meet you there.

148
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,202
Okay.

149
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:26,522
Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!

150
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,327
Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.

151
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,472
-Hey, Chandler.
-Hey, Joe.

152
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,649
Everybody's gotta be doing something.

153
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,850
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

154
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,856
If you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

155
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,288
Yeah, we are.

156
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,387
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

157
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,592
I'm calling for Monica Geller. I wanted to
let her know that there was a cancellation.

158
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,830
If she's still interested in having the
Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...

159
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,667
...it is available..

160
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,671
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

161
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,540
Yes, the groom.

162
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,112
No, not the groom!

163
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,282
It's so secluded up here.

164
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,489
I know. That's why I like it here.

165
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,784
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

166
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,720
Sorry.

167
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,866
What's the matter, honey?

168
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,467
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!

169
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,632
I think I..

170
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:49,474
-Actually, would you go check on that?
-We don't have any bears here.

171
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,944
Well, okay.

172
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,084
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

173
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,550
-Okay. Be right back.
-Okay.

174
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,352
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

175
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,623
-I came with Paul!
-Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

176
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,401
-Where is Elizabeth?
-She's at the store.

177
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,572
-You make the girl go to the store?
-Do I know where the store is?

178
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,599
Hurry up. Get out.

179
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,134
Here you go, honey.

180
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,881
-Thank you!
-Diet Coke.

181
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,141
Ice.

182
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,310
I need ice.

183
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,280
Okay.

184
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,190
-Thank you.
-Be right back.

185
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,381
Okay.

186
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,160
You and your ice.

187
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,559
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!

188
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,697
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

189
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,067
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Go!

190
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,136
Here you go, honey.

191
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,740
One Diet Coke with ice.

192
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,683
Thank you.

193
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,254
I am so happy that you're here.

194
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,186
-Here I am!
-Elizabeth!

195
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,457
Look! Elizabeth's here!

196
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,192
Who were you talking to?

197
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,629
You guys?

198
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,730
How did you know we were here?

199
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,071
She obviously saw the tire tracks
leading up to the closed garage.

200
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,674
Obviously.

201
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,746
What are you doing here?

202
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,719
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

203
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,053
Yeah.

204
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,624
Well, why don't you go in that room
and do your homework?

205
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,335
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.

206
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,872
That's your dad's bedroom.

207
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,609
That's your dad's bedroom!

208
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,943
Why are you yelling?

209
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,114
That Diet Coke, I think,
just straight to my head!

210
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,319
Hi, honey.

211
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,688
See you later.

212
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,525
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,131
Well, next time, ask!

214
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,597
Or at least wait for me to ask!

215
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,085
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

216
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,188
-I'm calling for Monica Geller.
-Oh, no.

217
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,152
I wanted to let her know
that there was a cancellation.

218
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,921
If she's still interested in having the
Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...

219
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,324
it is available...

220
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,226
Please. He didn't hear it!

221
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,027
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

222
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,862
No!

223
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,840
Can I help you?

224
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,812
Yeah, where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

225
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,006
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!

226
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:16,416
Make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani
stopped by to drop off all these clothes.

227
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,420
I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture on the wall.

228
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,419
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

229
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,456
Oh, really?

230
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,529
Well, maybe you and I go out
for drinks.

231
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,800
You're the other one, right?

232
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,539
So, Lizzie, are you planning on
staying the night?

233
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,312
No, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

234
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,412
Good. Not that we don't want you
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.

235
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,747
How much more homework
do you have?

236
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,552
I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

237
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,093
Rachel, maybe you wanna come
upstairs and help me figure it out?

238
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,621
Really?

239
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,424
Okay.

240
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,831
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

241
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,769
if you get me something
from the car.

242
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,941
What do you need from the car?

243
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,699
Surprise me.

244
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,168
Okay.

245
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,379
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!

246
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,678
That's where everybody's gonna be!

247
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,579
Just relax. Relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

248
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,949
She likes you.

249
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,650
I think she likes you. She likes you.

250
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,649
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

251
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,719
You are the man.

252
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,487
You are the man!

253
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,096
Still got it.

254
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,501
Still sexy.

255
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,769
You're just a love machine.

256
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,456
Showtime.

257
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,023
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

258
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,964
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?

259
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,968
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...

260
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,267
and that we could move up our
wedding. And Chandler heard.

261
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,477
I know. How bad is this?

262
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,477
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!

263
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,515
I know! And he totally freaked out.
I can't find him anywhere!

264
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,884
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm never going to listen to you again.

265
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,924
"What harm can it do
if you put your name down?"

266
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,993
-Rachel said that.
-Well, Rachel's not here!

267
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,636
You really think she put
your picture up already?

268
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,672
Did she put my picture up?

269
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,469
You kidding, after the date we had?

270
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,545
I wouldn't be surprised if she put
10 of my pictures up there.

271
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,310
Except for the fact that I only gave her one.
I don't know where she'd get the other nine.

272
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,554
Here it is!

273
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,790
Joey, why did you sign it
"son of a bitch"?

274
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,365
-I didn't do that. Who would do that?
-Son of a bitch!

275
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,791
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

276
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,463
-You! Get out of my shop!
-What did he do?

277
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,799
-He went out with my wife!
-Joey!

278
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,336
I did not go out with your wife! Okay?

279
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,202
I went out with her.

280
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,314
That's my wife!

281
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,381
I'm not pointing at her, no.
I'm pointing at her.

282
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,488
"Zelda McMurray."

283
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,982
Who the hell..?
How did she get up there?!

284
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,217
Get out!

285
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,297
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.

286
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,692
Ross?

287
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,202
Elizabeth!

288
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,681
Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.

289
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,507
I'll meet you at the front door.
Tell them you're going home.

290
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,119
-Okay.
-Wait! No, don't go in there!

291
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,114
Don't go in there!
I need another soda!

292
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,383
Ross!

293
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,853
Oh, my God, Ross! What in
heaven's name are you doing here?

294
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,226
And that is why
we cannot see each other anymore.

295
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,904
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

296
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,306
-Daddy, I..
-You're next!

297
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,482
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

298
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,650
Let me just see if I got this straight.

299
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,153
I tell you to stay away from
my daughter or I'll have you fired.

300
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,724
What you heard was:
"Take my daughter...

301
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,829
come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."

302
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,827
-Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
-No! Let me explain! Fired!

303
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,965
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

304
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,068
But I want you to know...

305
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,306
that you and I are not
all that different. I mean...

306
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,245
I, too, am a "neat guy."

307
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,953
What?

308
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,688
And I, too...

309
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,461
am "just a love machine."

310
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,193
-Let me show you the guest room.
-Okay.

311
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,141
I'm so sorry.
Please stop freaking out.

312
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,701
I'm not freaking out.

313
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,710
Why would I? A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.

314
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,715
But that happens every day.

315
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,951
Honey, we were at
this beautiful place...

316
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,286
and I just put our names down for fun.

317
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,259
-I mean, what's the harm in that?
-Right here.

318
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,462
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

319
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,968
-Phoebe and Rachel thought..
-Phoebe and Rachel?

320
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,539
So the people that knew about
our wedding before me were you...

321
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:22,339
Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy, and some
band called the Starlight Magic Seven...

322
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,674
who are available, by the way.

323
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,185
It was a mistake.

324
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,014
Please don't take this to mean
anything, because it doesn't.

325
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,885
Okay.

326
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,887
Really?

327
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,525
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm not ready.

328
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,723
I know.

329
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,294
I know.

330
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,196
Okay.

331
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,198
All right.

332
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,070
I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

333
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,068
We were really worried about you.

334
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,442
And that guy that
never delivered his burrito?

335
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,084
He thought there was
some sort of connection.

336
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,815
Did she buy it?

337
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,450
Totally.

338
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,891
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah. It's beautiful.

339
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,126
I can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.

340
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,393
I know.

00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,140
-Hey, Gunther.
-Take these cappuccinos to table 11.

342
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,946
And that guy wants some biscotti.

343
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,549
I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee.

344
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,954
Do you still work here?

345
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,890
No. I quit a long time ago.

346
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,258
Did I forget to tell you that?
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,396
-Cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!
