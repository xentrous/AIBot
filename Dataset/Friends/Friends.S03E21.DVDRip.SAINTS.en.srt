1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,503
Are you still on hold?

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,172
I was supposed to call my dad back
two hours ago.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,873
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,044
Call him as soon as you get a chance.
He's at Flimbees.

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,546
What's Flimbees?

6
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,739
That's the word I use when
I can't remember the real thing.

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,616
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,947
No. That's what they want me to do.

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,851
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through...

10
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,720
...they won't fix my crappy,
broken phone for free!

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,122
We cannot let them win!
It's us versus them!

12
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,695
Yes!

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,956
I say hang up.

14
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,865
It's Chandler and us
versus Monica and them.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,063
- Hey.
- Hey.

16
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,334
I gotta double-check for tickets
tonight. Who got what?

17
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,611
I have one.

18
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,212
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,775
My boyfriend.

20
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,910
I have a boyfriend now.

21
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,911
Two it is. How about you?

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,190
Yeah, I also need two.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,857
Really? Who's number two?

24
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:06,565
Whose Number Two? One of the more
difficult games sewer workers play.

25
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,694
No one, it's just this person.

26
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,729
Like a date-type person?

27
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,634
Yeah, kind of.
It's this woman from work.

28
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,775
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

29
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,238
Not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself.

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,809
But you said one ticket.

31
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,489
I meant me plus one.

32
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,652
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

33
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,693
All right. I'll see you tonight.

34
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,932
Okay. Bye-bye.

35
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,200
Bye-bye.

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,228
Okay, I need a date!

37
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,707
Oh, hey! You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate!

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,467
And I borrowed your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

39
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,372
What are you doing?
She's seeing somebody.

40
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,877
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,345
- Bottle next to the shaving cream.
- Worm medicine for the duck.

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,828
The One With the Screamer

43
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:55,269
- Here you go. You can wear this.
- Thanks. Okay.

44
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,074
I'm setting the phone down.

45
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,644
But I'm still here.

46
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,979
Just don't go anywhere.
I'm still here.

47
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,579
Don't switch or anything, because
I'm right here. Just one sec.

48
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,116
One sec. One second!

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,855
Wait! One second! Just...

50
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,564
What? Monica, I'm scared!

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,896
Honey, that's a sleeve.

52
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,662
And we also have a speakerphone.

53
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,102
Please stay on the line.
Your call is important to us.

54
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,410
You gotta hang up.
We'll be late.

55
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,272
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

56
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,946
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,918
You were gonna have me hang up.

58
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,751
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,860
Of course not.

60
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,192
I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

61
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,269
All right, fellas, back to Nintendo.

62
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,172
Oh, hi, how are you?

63
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,505
Good.

64
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,251
- Looks like we're the first ones here.
- Looks that way.

65
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,645
First ones here!

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,885
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

67
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,391
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.
Cailin...

68
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,663
Sorry.

69
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,323
And break!

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,138
I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

71
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,568
- I'll join you.
- I'll get our seats.

72
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,444
Well, this is...

73
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,771
...awkward.

74
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,109
Well, because Rachel and I
used to go out.

75
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,045
Oh, I didn't know that.

76
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,051
Well, then this is awkward.

77
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,317
- So, what do you...?
- I think we're here.

78
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,598
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

79
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,994
I think you may be in our seats.

80
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,361
No, I don't think so.

81
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,164
- Could we take a look at your ticket?
- Sure.

82
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,840
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13"...

83
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,675
Oh, well, I thought that...

84
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,477
You thought? Well, that didn't
really work out for you. Idiot!

85
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,679
What are you, a moron?
It says, "D-13"! Okay?

86
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,051
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?

87
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,258
- The usher told me...
- The usher must be right!

88
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,327
With all his training!

89
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,926
Get out!

90
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,836
Here!

91
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,132
- Hey, man, you want the aisle?
- No, I'm good.

92
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,323
- There he is!
- There's our star!

93
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,148
You were great!

94
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,621
So? What'd you think?

95
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,829
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

96
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,733
- I wasn't in that.
- I know.

97
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,966
I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.

98
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,638
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sweetheart!

99
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,578
Come!

100
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,610
So that's the girl you like.

101
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,448
I tell you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy.

102
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:35,490
He viciously screamed at total
strangers. I think he's bad news.

103
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,590
Wait a minute. You don't like
the guy Rachel's dating?

104
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,159
Well, that's odd.

105
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,763
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is
Kate's understudy, Lauren.

106
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,042
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

107
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,005
I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

108
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,079
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

109
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,819
So how'd you guys meet?

110
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,054
The short version is, I pursued
her for a couple of months.

111
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,383
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

112
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,725
In the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

113
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,901
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

114
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,596
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

115
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,034
How do you do?

116
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,302
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

117
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,938
Do they have representation?

118
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,610
They weren't in the play.

119
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,281
We're not actors.

120
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,586
What a shame!

121
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:39,083
With her face and her chest,
I could really put something together.

122
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,759
Could I borrow it?

123
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,063
Hi. Remember me?

124
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,462
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line
for the bathroom...

125
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,762
...and someone just cut.
I think he's gonna snap.

126
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,602
I'm gonna go.

127
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,271
Go? Why?

128
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,275
I don't know. Could be
because I don't feel like...

129
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,641
...waiting all night for a guy
who may or may not scream.

130
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,313
He definitely will scream.

131
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,782
Goodbye.

132
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,620
Here we go, people!

133
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,704
"Boxing Day.

134
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,572
The Lucille Lortel Theatre...

135
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:35,339
Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

136
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,010
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production."

137
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,276
Yes!

138
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:48,390
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable."

139
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,957
Here it is! "The direction...

140
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,496
...by Marshall Townend is..."

141
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,366
Thank you, boys and girls.

142
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,271
You've ruined my life.

143
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,015
Please stuff your talentless faces...

144
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,581
...with my mother's crab cakes!

145
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,747
Excuse me!

146
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,527
Does anyone mind if I save this?

147
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,964
- Is the play over?
- Where were you?

148
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,233
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

149
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,132
You were "the next caller" hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

150
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,571
I've kept myself busy.

151
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,185
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

152
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,332
You okay?

153
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,634
Fabulous.

154
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:07,737
Drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

155
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,305
- You know what to do?
- Become a drama critic.

156
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,646
I am hurt!

157
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,983
A plague...

158
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,548
...on both your houses!

159
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,717
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

160
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,725
Oh, classy.

161
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,867
I sure know how to pick them.

162
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,596
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

163
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,437
I gave up a job too.

164
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,946
- Really? What?
- Declawing cats.

165
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,610
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

166
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:57,015
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of The Times and The Post.

167
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,620
- Why The Post?
- You didn't see The Post?

168
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,622
- No. You?
- No. Why?

169
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,036
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

170
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,571
Absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

171
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,567
You're sweet and cute.

172
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,211
I know. That's why they trashed me.

173
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,513
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What?

174
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,322
I don't get you.

175
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,529
I mean, first you hate me.

176
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,458
Then you sleep with me.

177
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,767
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

178
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,561
You never went out
with an actress before?

179
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,769
Kate, do you even like me?

180
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,274
- Of course I do.
- So how come you blew me off?

181
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,883
- How come you were with him?
- I don't know.

182
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,316
I just do this.

183
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,858
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy...

184
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,684
...or the most talented guy.

185
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,428
Why can't I just
pick someone like you?

186
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,793
Thanks.

187
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,738
You know what I mean.

188
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,074
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

189
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,272
You're just so...

190
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,706
You're so...

191
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,016
...so...

192
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,525
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

193
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,806
Good night.

194
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,341
Sweet dreams.

195
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,588
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

196
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,958
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.

197
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,366
You've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep.

198
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,797
This isn't healthy.

199
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,700
No, no, I'm fine.

200
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,341
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

201
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,751
Didn't you have that on last night?

202
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,587
I stayed at Kate's
but nothing happened.

203
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,584
Yeah, last time I was
at Pete's we just watched a movie...

204
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,657
...of us...

205
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,463
...that we'd made earlier.

206
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,265
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
I have a boyfriend.

207
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,260
Hey, where were you?

208
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,269
I'm so, so sorry.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

209
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,010
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

210
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,181
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

211
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,348
How'd it go with Kate?

212
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,519
It was great!

213
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,350
I walked her home, and it was
amazing how much we connected.

214
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,991
Then she passed out.

215
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,988
But then she woke up.

216
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,627
And we stayed up all night talking.

217
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,060
And now we're crazy about each other!

218
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,133
You had "the night"!

219
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,263
When two people realize
their feelings for each other...

220
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:39,034
...and they talk for hours and learn
all about the other person.

221
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,300
You think?

222
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,446
- Did you learn about her family?
- Two brothers. One died!

223
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,581
Yes!

224
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,792
This is from the woman at the bar.

225
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,327
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

226
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,437
- What time is it?
- One.

227
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,105
7:15.

228
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,573
Watch doesn't work.

229
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,108
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

230
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,417
Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but...

231
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,283
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

232
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,653
You don't?

233
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,227
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

234
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,798
Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

235
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,534
It's not just because I'm jealous.

236
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,640
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

237
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,770
Look, the guy actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

238
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,346
Yeah, and at the end of the play...

239
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,584
...he got up, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

240
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,618
You don't want to believe me,
that's fine.

241
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,986
We're kidding.

242
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,992
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

243
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,202
- Sorry, Tommy.
- What's in the cup?

244
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,033
What is in the cup?

245
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,333
Okay, it's coffee.

246
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,840
Iced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.

247
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,048
- It's hot...
- Hot coffee!

248
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,108
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

249
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,847
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

250
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,729
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

251
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:44,058
Going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

252
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,168
What's your favorite thing
about summer?

253
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,339
I don't know. Probably the smell
of freshly cut grass.

254
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,375
That's a good one.

255
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,317
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

256
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,156
We held the curtain for you.
Let's go!

257
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,693
Vic! Where have you been, baby?

258
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:22,939
Where's Kate?

259
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,540
She got a job in L.A.

260
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:32,247
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

261
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,552
Where have you been, Vic?

262
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,525
Go to the window. I wanna run down
to the truck and show you something.

263
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,227
What do you got down there, Vic?

264
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,058
What do you got under that tarp?

265
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,195
When is she leaving?

266
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,167
Tonight. What are you doing?

267
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,004
I'm coming up!

268
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,111
Hey, you hanging in there?

269
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,482
You doing okay?

270
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,157
You listening to me?

271
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,985
Okay.

272
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,460
If Pete calls again,
and you don't put him through...

273
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,826
...I will kill you.

274
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,229
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

275
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,202
Use ours across the hall
because she...

276
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,841
...has problems.

277
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,080
Thanks.

278
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,117
Sorry, Tommy.

279
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,148
I almost spilled this
hot coffee on you.

280
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,915
Yeah, but you didn't.

281
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,383
No, but...

282
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,152
...it's hot.

283
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,557
Would you stop it?
It's getting really old.

284
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,768
I can't believe no one believes me.

285
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,636
I do. I believe you.

286
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,038
You do?

287
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,638
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

288
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,241
Hey there, little fella.

289
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,783
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

290
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,124
Gross!

291
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,694
Idiot!

292
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,696
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

293
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,867
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute!
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"

294
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,638
You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

295
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,470
What are you quacking about?

296
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,536
Dumb Donald Dodo!

297
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,948
Step away from the duck.

298
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,447
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

299
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,659
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

300
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,890
I guess we're not going out anymore.

301
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,189
Man!

302
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,437
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

303
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,706
What's all this about L.A.?

304
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,977
They still want me
for General Hospital.

305
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,180
But...

306
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,978
...what about us?

307
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,341
Last night was wonderful.

308
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,478
But I can't stay here just for you.

309
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,590
So stay for the museums.

310
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,687
- I'm sorry.
- Joey, on-stage!

311
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,521
At least stay till the end
of the play.

312
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,631
I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

313
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,300
Where are you, Vic?

314
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,066
Flight's in an hour.
I gotta go.

315
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,670
Vic?

316
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:42,974
Vic?

317
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,240
- Vic!
- In a minute!

318
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,279
So this is it, Victor?

319
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,378
Yeah. I guess it is.

320
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,415
Listen...

321
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,095
...I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

322
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,329
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

323
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,438
But you got things
you have to do now.

324
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,235
And so do I.

325
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,434
And so...

326
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,315
...I'm gonna get on
this spaceship...

327
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,059
...and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

328
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,297
But when I return
200 years from now...

329
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,029
...you'll be long gone...

330
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,695
...but I won't have aged at all.

331
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,768
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter...

332
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,374
...to look me up.

333
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,815
Because, Adrianne...

334
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,619
...baby...

335
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,980
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

336
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,527
So long, Vic!

337
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,808
It's been two days.

338
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,568
Yeah, I know.

339
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,181
Good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

340
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:35,384
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
801 is Utah.

341
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,552
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

342
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,795
Every...

343
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,095
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

344
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,503
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will pay you back.

345
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,800
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

346
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,668
- Hang up!
- Hang up the phone!

347
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,374
