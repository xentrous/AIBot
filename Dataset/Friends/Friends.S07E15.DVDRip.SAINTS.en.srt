1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,365
Thanks for coming by.

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,504
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,205
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- It's just...

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,877
Monica said, "wedding."

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,205
We thought one of you
could read something.

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,584
I would love to read a poem.

7
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,390
Do you think you could
get through a poem?

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,117
A short one.

9
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,560
Okay, so Ross will
be doing the reading.

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,499
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,301
Too?

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,236
I kind of have something else
planned for you guys.

13
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,104
- Do you mind telling us what it is?
- Sorry.

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,472
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the q. T.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,241
Whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

16
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,850
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,091
I talked to one of the DOOL writers...

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,326
- What is DOOL?
- Days of Our Lives.

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,957
You're not gonna believe it. My
character is coming out of his coma!

20
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,098
- That's wonderful.
- Wow, Joey.

21
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,894
And not only that,
I'm getting a new brain!

22
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,807
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

23
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,411
You're getting a new brain?

24
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,238
They're killing off
one of the characters on the show...

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,281
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

26
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,419
What? A brain transplant?

27
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,454
Yes, it's a highly
controversial procedure.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,456
It's ridiculous.

29
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,191
It's ridiculous that you haven't
had sex in three and a half months.

30
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,967
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

31
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,706
Who are they killing off?

32
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,212
Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

33
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,883
No!

34
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,684
She's my favorite character on DOOL.

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,457
Nice.

36
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,292
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

37
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,087
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a beverage.

38
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,832
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to do that?

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,534
Don't do it.

40
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,872
- Cecilia Monroe, what a great actress.
- Tell me about it.

41
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,837
And she's been on the show forever.

42
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,544
It's gonna be really hard
to fill her shoes.

43
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,171
Help me out here.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,712
When you come out
of the brain transplant...

45
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,717
...you are going to be her?

46
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,752
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

47
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,127
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

48
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,359
The One With Joey's New Brain

49
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,664
Rach, so that guy there...

50
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,928
...straight or gay?

51
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,842
Well, I'd have to say gay.

52
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,512
Yeah? Why?

53
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,080
Mainly because he's kissing
that other guy.

54
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,818
Oh, no, not that guy there.
That guy right there.

55
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,355
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight.

56
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,693
Knockers will help us
figure it out.

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,826
All right, straight.

58
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,297
And not subtle.

59
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,072
He left his cell phone.

60
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,767
We could hand it to Gunther
to put it in lost and found.

61
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,503
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

62
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,185
What if he calls his own cell phone
and I answer...

63
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,716
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?

64
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,981
Wouldn't that be a great story?

65
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,921
Kind of like a fairy tale
for the digital age.

66
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,663
That does sound great.
I'm gonna get the phone.

67
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,126
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

68
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,893
I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

69
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,502
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

70
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:38,140
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

71
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,412
Okay. Great. I get the phone.

72
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,648
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

73
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,944
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think
I would love again.

74
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,150
- Nice try.
- Wait.

75
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,324
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,288
I don't know.

77
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,334
Maybe we could...

78
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,601
Aha! Too slow!

79
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,402
Aha! Too cocky.

80
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm dating him.
There's nothing you can do.

81
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,050
Yes, there is.

82
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,412
What are you going to do, kill him?
Like you did Charles?

83
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,953
That was an accident.

84
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,854
And so were you.

85
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,661
Well, at least I'm not a murderer.

86
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,729
Oh, my baby.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,304
Cut!

88
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,713
That was a great scene. That slap
looked so real. How do you do that?

89
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,441
- Oh, just years of experience.
- Can I get some ice here?!

90
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,750
I just wanted to say how wonderful
I think you are.

91
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,490
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

92
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,859
I'm supposed to meet
and hug a fan who's dying.

93
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,862
But that's not suppose
to be until later.

94
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,934
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

95
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,401
- I'm the guy in the coma.
- Oh, that was a real person?

96
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,273
Since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

97
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,275
...I was wondering if...

98
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,847
- I'm leaving the show?
- Why? Did you hear something?

99
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,380
Who told you that?

100
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,982
- One of the writers.
- Which writer? Was it bald or was it tall?

101
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,896
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

102
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,188
Okay.

103
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,957
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

104
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,761
...about a character I've played
for 20 years!

105
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,468
Miss Monroe...
Oh, there you go.

106
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,883
No, Phoebe, you cannot get the phone
that way. That's not fair.

107
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,289
Okay, look, I have an idea.

108
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,124
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial...

109
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:19,270
...and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.

110
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,338
Or we can decide by whoever's name
is closer to the word "phone."

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,845
I don't think so.

112
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,379
Fine. But I bet you'd be singing a different
tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.

113
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,214
First name on the speed dial is "Mom."

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,622
Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.

115
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,959
No way. You can't use that to get the
cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.

116
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,601
Did I use that already
today? I'm sorry.

117
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,069
Well, now, see,
this isn't telling us anything.

118
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:59,370
- "Joe. Carlos. Yoga. Ben..."
- Wait. I do yoga. That's one for me.

119
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,309
Oh, all right. Oh, so close.
If only it said, "yogurt."

120
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,751
"Peter Luger." That's a steak house.

121
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,816
Okay, fine. Meat-eater.
Fine, that's one for you.

122
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,122
Oh, I win. He's got Barneys
on his speed dial.

123
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,659
You don't know it's Barneys
the store.

124
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,398
That could be his friend's
house or a bar...

125
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,725
Who has Barneys the store
on their speed dial?

126
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,969
His new girlfriend.

127
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,480
What is that?

128
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,283
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

129
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,918
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

130
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,525
- Oh, my God.
- What?

131
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,995
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,762
He was hanging out with me and said,
"You're half Scottish, right?"

133
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,876
- No.
- Yes!

134
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,915
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

135
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,667
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

136
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,564
Why is your family Ross?

137
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,474
He cannot play at our wedding.
Everyone will leave.

138
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,805
It'll be like when he rapped
at my bat mitzvah.

139
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,246
We can't just tell him no. He's probably
been practicing forever. He'll be crushed.

140
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,285
Maybe there's a way we can tell him
without hurting his feelings.

141
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,048
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

142
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,621
It's not even a song.

143
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,061
Wait. If you listen very carefully...

144
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,198
...I think it's "Celebration"
by Kool and the Gang.

145
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,073
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

146
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,647
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

147
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,785
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

148
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:26,387
I was gonna keep it in my purse so if
it rang, I could just pick it up?

149
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,590
Do you remember going into my purse
and stealing the phone?

150
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,260
Now you lost me.

151
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,802
- You stole the phone.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,901
You're saying that if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

153
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,171
- No.
- Okay.

154
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,807
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

155
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,413
Oh, it does work.

156
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,581
- Phoebe.
- That is a different phone.

157
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:57,380
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi,
is Rachel there?

158
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,820
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

159
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,490
That is damning evidence.

160
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,400
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

161
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,860
My digital fairy tale's
about to begin.

162
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,433
I wonder how it should be?
Should I be, "Hello"?

163
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,667
Or should I be, "Hi! It's Ra..."?

164
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,341
Would you stop doing that?

165
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,276
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

166
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,143
- Phoebe, you can't...
- I'm on a call.

167
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,952
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?

168
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,921
At my apartment.

169
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,529
It's 5 Morton Street,
apartment 14.

170
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,733
And then maybe, you know, after,
we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

171
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,231
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

172
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,938
You do know that I will be here
when he comes over.

173
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,302
How will you know what time
to come over?

174
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,705
You just said it.

175
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,785
Well, I was kind of hoping
that I would just be alone.

176
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,357
You know, to think about my mom
and her suicide.

177
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,462
- Oh, Phoebe!
- What? That's the first time today.

178
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,030
So you like the nachos, huh?

179
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,899
- Myself, I'm partial to...
- I'm 16.

180
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,631
See you in 2003.

181
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,278
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.

182
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,712
They don't know exactly when
it's going to happen, but soon...

183
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,452
...and then that's it.

184
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,587
I'm so sorry. If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

185
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,825
- Yeah, thanks.
- I mean it.

186
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,186
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

187
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,627
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

188
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,064
Oh, you're right.

189
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,897
Thank you.

190
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,833
What's your name again?

191
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,532
- Joey.
- Thank you.

192
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,901
That is so sweet.

193
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,974
Excuse me.

194
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,682
- It wasn't my decision.
- I'm having a conversation here.

195
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,815
You were saying.

196
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,949
Look, the only reason
I came up to you before...

197
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,026
...is because, well...

198
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,754
...I'm really nervous about being you.

199
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:24,632
If you could help me capture
the essence of the character, you know.

200
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,362
Help me keep Jessica alive.
Please?

201
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,140
All right, Joey, I'll help you.

202
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,675
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

203
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,949
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

204
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,778
- Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

205
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,578
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

206
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,788
Jessica Lockhart will never
step foot in this place again!

207
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,152
Never!

208
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,623
- Is that supposed to be me?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,199
But Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

210
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,028
I can do an English accent?

211
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,041
That baby's going on my résumé.

212
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,513
Well, I feel like a snack.

213
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,150
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

214
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,589
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

215
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,290
What?

216
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,759
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

217
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,397
...Vikings.

218
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,862
Anyway, lots of bad memories.

219
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,103
It sounds to me like your family's
ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.

220
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,542
No. No, they're not.

221
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,239
They're still very angry.

222
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,850
But, you know, Chandler's also
half-Swedish.

223
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,680
You know what the Swedish people
are famous for?

224
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,323
Sitting down and being quiet.

225
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,390
Yeah, but the Scottish history
is so much...

226
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,962
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

227
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,065
How did you know about that?

228
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,932
- We heard you play from your apartment.
- Were you the ones who called the cops?

229
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,768
That's not really important right now.

230
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,377
What is important is, while we
appreciate the gesture...

231
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,550
...we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

232
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,787
- Why not?
- Because we hate them.

233
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,084
Come on, that's not fair.
You haven't even heard me play.

234
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,623
We have heard you play.

235
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,522
No, you've heard me practice.

236
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:35,189
Just give me a chance to perform for
you, then decide whatever you want.

237
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,666
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play either.

238
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,633
Let's just say when it's over...

239
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,603
...I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit of celebration.

240
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,310
The essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

241
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,183
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

242
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,287
...she owns everything...

243
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,050
...and every person in that room.

244
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,224
- You try it.
- Okay.

245
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,234
All right!

246
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,974
No. He already knows
that he owns everything in the room.

247
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,646
He's not finding it
out for the first time.

248
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,247
- So try it again.
- Okay.

249
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,524
He's not angry at the room either.

250
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,726
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

251
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:42,366
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

252
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,161
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

253
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,175
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

254
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,570
It's been 20 years of my life.

255
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,378
Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

256
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,414
It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

257
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,982
You're so talented.

258
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,486
I am, I am.

259
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,283
But I don't know. You know...

260
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,759
...an actor of a certain age,
it's not that easy.

261
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:17,401
That's not true. Look at Angela
Lansbur... Angelina Jolie.

262
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:24,232
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

263
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,308
...but I just got
so comfy here and...

264
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,206
I turned down some amazing work.

265
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,610
Like what?

266
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,209
Well, let's just say
if I'd left 15 years ago...

267
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,820
...the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

268
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,385
Wow.

269
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,631
But, well, now...
Now's a different time for me.

270
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,237
Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

271
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,634
Let me tell you something, okay?

272
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,370
When I watch you do a scene, I'm
thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."

273
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:07,017
But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."

274
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,057
You think I'm hot?

275
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,919
You own the room.

276
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,196
We should probably get the...

277
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,425
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

278
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,406
So when Jessica kisses a man...

279
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,936
...she usually puts...

280
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,307
...both her hands on the man's face.

281
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,246
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

282
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,650
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

283
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,257
You want to try it?

284
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,429
Yeah, okay.

285
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,644
That was good. That was really good.

286
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,445
But I think that maybe your hands are
just a little off. They should be right...

287
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,190
Hey, hey!

288
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,423
Who is it?

289
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,228
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.

290
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,370
Why do you get to answer the door?

291
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,075
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's my apartment.

292
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,311
Then I get to give him the cell phone.

293
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,843
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

294
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,046
Hi.

295
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,186
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

296
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,726
You're not the man who left the phone.

297
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,062
- No, that's my assistant.
- Is he coming?

298
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,164
No.

299
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,100
- Could you give us one second?
- Sure.

300
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,468
We'll be right back, sir.

301
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,109
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

302
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,677
Can you believe this?

303
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,919
We were waiting for a hot guy,
and then an even hotter one shows up.

304
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,483
I know.

305
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,682
What?

306
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,287
They just don't make them
like that anymore, you know?

307
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,262
No, they do,
but you just have to wait.

308
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,167
Rachel, listen...

309
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,369
...if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

310
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,678
All right.

311
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,680
All right, I will let you have him.

312
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,988
But you owe me. You owe me big.

313
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,953
Yeah. You're such a great friend.

314
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,460
Which one of you lovely
ladies am I taking to dinner?

315
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,788
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

316
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,460
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

317
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,596
Nice.

318
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,275
Well, you certainly own that room.

319
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,114
Actually, I rent the whole place.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.

320
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,516
- Hi.
- Hey.

321
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,524
Oh, my God.

322
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,528
Oh, my God.

323
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,894
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

324
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,195
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

325
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,665
It's nice to know...

326
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,235
Monica!

327
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,202
That's my roommate, Rachel.

328
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,377
That explains all
the women's underwear.

329
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,081
Sure.

330
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,751
Oh, my God, it's true!

331
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,984
Oh, my God, you are so amazing.

332
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,954
Can I just ask you to do me
just one favor?

333
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,492
Certainly.

334
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,389
Would you slap me
right here in the face?

335
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,900
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

336
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,203
God, you seem really, really nice.

337
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,602
Okay, bye-bye.

338
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,779
I mean, not fake at all
like most famous people.

339
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,573
All right, here we go.

340
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,851
No, wait. Just one more thing.

341
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,287
- You're a stupid bitch.
- I really can't slap you.

342
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,982
- You are so beautiful.
- So nice to meet you.

343
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,459
- My God, you're great.
- Thanks for stopping by.

344
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,493
- I am so sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

345
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,464
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

346
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,070
- Oh, my God.
- What?

347
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,101
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

348
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,435
- They don't?
- I'm just in a coma.

349
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,010
This must mean I have lines.

350
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,785
How does it happen?

351
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,184
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

352
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,088
A what? Jessica hates horses.

353
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,233
After this, she's not gonna be crazy
about electricity either.

354
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,936
Now, remember,
you have to imagine me in a kilt.

355
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:37,113
I can imagine you in a short
plaid skirt and knee socks.

356
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,049
- You wanna start telling secrets?
- No.

357
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,447
Now, remember...

358
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,649
...I'm still learning.

359
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,736
One, two, three, four!

360
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,390
You know the song. Sing along.

361
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,181
So?

362
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,980
- No.
- No.

363
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,691
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

364
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,428
And the electric fence, inspired.

365
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,992
Thank you, sweetheart.

366
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,398
I can't believe she's really gone.

367
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,097
Look around you. All of this is ours.

368
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,532
I don't think so.

369
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,714
Who are you?

370
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,710
What's the matter, Dina?

371
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,475
Don't you recognize your own...

372
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,117
...mother?

373
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,482
Cut! That was great, everybody.
Thank you.

374
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,092
That was so wonderful!

375
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,490
I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

376
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,495
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, but you were good.

377
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,758
Thanks.

378
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,095
Good news. I got another job.

379
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,601
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

380
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,967
A film in Guadalajara.

381
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,545
The airport?

382
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,979
No, that's LaGuardia.

383
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,750
- This is Mexico.
- Oh, wow.

384
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,151
Well, how long will you be gone?

385
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,087
Eight months.

386
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,520
- That's a really long time.
- Yeah, but you could come and visit.

387
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,826
I bet that you could own
a few places down there.

388
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,573
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

389
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,943
And I just got what you meant.
That is...

390
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,339
- That's a tricky one.
- It's tricky.

391
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,214
Joey, I really want to thank you.

392
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,256
You made a very difficult time for me
a little less painful.

393
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,694
Good luck.

394
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,061
You too.
