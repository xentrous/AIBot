1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,932
We learned one thing, Cheese:

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,470
Cheerleaders and high explosives
don't mix.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,673
You can say that again, Mac.

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,346
I couldn't have done it alone.
You're a genius.

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:20,415
Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can't get
my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?

6
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,458
What did you guys think?

7
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,198
- Hey, the phone.
- I got it. I got it.

8
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,802
Hold on. It's your mom.

9
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,833
- It's Mommy.
- That's nice.

10
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,131
Ma. So, what did you think?

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,201
Well...

12
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,874
...that was okay.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,374
It wasn't the best.

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,979
That was one
of the worst things ever...

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,583
...and not just on TV.

16
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,382
- What should we say?
- The lighting was okay.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,591
You got lighting last time.
Lighting is mine.

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,028
I have costumes.

19
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,626
That means I'm stuck with:

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,799
"So we were watching you in there
and you were sitting right here."

21
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,836
- What about you?
- I don't know.

22
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,232
I can't lie to him again.
Oh, no, I... No.

23
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,102
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

24
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,571
- And say nothing?
- Yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,450
My folks really liked it.

26
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,150
What did you guys think?

27
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,990
It wasn't that good.

28
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,924
The One With Rachel's Assistant

29
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,962
Do you think that your favorite animal
says much about you?

30
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,899
You mean behind my back?

31
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,509
You'll never believe
what happened to me today.

32
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,779
- I am sitting in my office...
- You guys!

33
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,604
Guess what my agent just said?

34
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,472
I'm in the middle of a story here.

35
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,045
Sorry, you finish.

36
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,016
I'm sitting in my office,
and guess who walks in.

37
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,186
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,422
That's great.

39
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,223
- Joey.
- You weren't finished?

40
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,520
Yeah, "Guess who walks
into my office" is my story.

41
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,624
Ralph Lauren walked into my office.

42
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,393
If you're starting another story,
at least let me finish mine.

43
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,038
It's the same story.

44
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,039
It's really long.

45
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,236
Ralph just came in to tell me
that he's so happy with my work...

46
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,382
...that he wants me to be the new
merchandising manager for Polo retail.

47
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,583
- Still get a discount on wedding gowns?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,754
I'm so happy for you.

49
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,384
These really are
the "days of our lives."

50
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,561
- What?
- Well, since you ask...

51
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,331
They want me back on
Days of Our Lives.

52
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,931
I get a big pay raise!

53
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,225
Oh, hey!

54
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,801
I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's
twin brother, Stryker.

55
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,037
I get to hire my own assistant.

56
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,178
I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

57
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,480
You were at this job four years?

58
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,985
- That's right.
- This is all very impressive, Hilda.

59
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,384
I just have one last question for you:

60
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,319
How did I do? Was this okay?

61
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,757
- What?
- I've never interviewed anyone.

62
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,024
I've never had anyone work for me.

63
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,430
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

64
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,831
No, dear, it's not.

65
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,241
And I know that.

66
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,513
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

67
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,679
- Nice to meet you.
- Good meeting you.

68
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,211
All right.

69
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,186
I'm a total pro.

70
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,787
Hello.

71
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,120
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.

72
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,523
I'm here about the assistant job.

73
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,990
Really?

74
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,467
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.

75
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,931
So, what's your name?

76
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,203
Tag Jones.

77
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,234
Go on.

78
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,207
That's it. That's my whole name.

79
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,409
That's your whole name.
Of course it is.

80
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,309
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.

81
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,041
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience...

82
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,188
What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses...

83
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,191
...two whole summers
at TGI Friday's.

84
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,021
It's lame, I know.

85
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,992
But I'm a goal-oriented person,
eager to learn...

86
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,030
Just hold on a second, please.

87
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,240
It's for human resources. Everybody
has to. Would you stand up?

88
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,382
No, no, no.

89
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,189
Hey.

90
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,426
- Anyway, I should go.
- Okay. Bye.

91
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,366
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, sweetie.

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,505
What was with all the whispering?

93
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,909
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,781
Secret? Married people aren't
supposed to have secrets.

95
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,482
We love and respect
one another too much.

96
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,385
But still, no.

97
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:59,190
We should tell each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

98
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,691
Really? So tell me what happened
to Ross junior year at Disneyland.

99
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,588
No, I can't do that.

100
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,267
I'll tell you what Phoebe said.

101
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

102
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,531
So Ross and I
are going to Disneyland.

103
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,830
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

104
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,510
When I say "restaurant," I mean a guy,
a hibachi and the trunk of his car.

105
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,042
So Ross has about 10 tacos.

106
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,614
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

107
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,386
Oh, my God. He threw up?

108
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,885
No, he visited a town
a little south of throw up.

109
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,417
- No.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,460
Some of the employees decided
to rename the park...

111
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,460
...the "Crappiest Place on Earth."

112
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,494
What was Phoebe's secret?

113
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,537
Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
old massage place, is getting fired.

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,313
That's it? I gave up my
Disneyland story for that?

115
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,114
That's right. You lose, sucker!

116
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,087
Please still marry me.

117
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,722
You have an assistant, right?

118
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,961
Did she call?

119
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,857
You told her I was sick, right?
Always tell her I am sick.

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,325
No, I just don't know,
how do you decide who to hire?

121
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,194
I have it down to two people.

122
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,337
One has great references
and a lot of experience.

123
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,905
- And then there's this guy...
- What about him?

124
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,604
I love him.

125
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,312
He's so pretty I want to cry.

126
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,847
I don't know what to do.

127
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,520
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

128
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:40,192
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're qualified.

129
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,693
I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,093
Look how pretty.

131
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,035
Let me see.

132
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,937
Oh, my God.

133
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,373
Oh. But no.

134
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,702
No. You can't hire him,
because it's not professional.

135
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,313
This is for me, yes?

136
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,120
Okay, you're right.
I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.

137
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,981
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.

138
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,758
Let me see.

139
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,694
Don't show this to Monica.

140
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,297
And don't tell her about the:

141
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,604
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Terry.

142
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,935
- Nice to see you again.
- Been a while.

143
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,873
Funny, these halls look smaller
than they used to.

144
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,344
It's a different building.

145
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,507
So...

146
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,146
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?

147
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,514
- When do I start?
- How about right now?

148
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,121
Okay.

149
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,694
Here are the audition scenes.

150
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,631
I thought you
were offering me the part.

151
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,934
Why?

152
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,534
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

153
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,171
Who looks more like me than me, right?

154
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,343
Everybody has to audition.

155
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,943
You know, Terry,
I don't really need to do this.

156
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,673
I got my own cable TV series...

157
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,714
...with a robot.

158
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,850
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

159
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,919
Well...

160
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,989
...I guess you think
you're pretty special.

161
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,562
Sitting up here in your fancy,
small-halled building...

162
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,465
...making stars jump
through hoops for you.

163
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,136
Well, you know what?

164
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,602
This is one star whose hoop...

165
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,936
This is the star the hoop...
This hoop...

166
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,077
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

167
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,821
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

168
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,389
I came to thank you for not laughing
in my face yesterday.

169
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,892
I noticed there aren't any plants,
so I brought you your first...

170
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,366
There is a plant in your office.

171
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,463
Kind of.

172
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,727
- And that was there yesterday, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,703
I got it the same time I got that one.

174
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,600
Right.

175
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,808
So I guess I shouldn't put
"good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.

176
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,180
- Thank you.
- Anyway...

177
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,416
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.

178
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,179
Well...

179
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,748
Gotcha.

180
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,157
Thanks again for meeting with me.

181
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,187
But I hired you.

182
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,962
- What?
- Yeah, you got the job.

183
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,133
- You're my new assistant.
- I am?

184
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,766
Yeah.

185
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,964
- I can't believe it.
- Me either.

186
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,807
- Rachel, thank you so much.
- Oh, big hug.

187
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,610
- Really?
- No, handshake.

188
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,582
Okay, let's get started.

189
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,048
First, I need you to go downstairs...

190
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,913
...find a woman named Hilda
and tell her to go home.

191
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,627
- Hey.
- Hey, good, you're home.

192
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,993
Always nicer to hear than,
"Oh, crap, you again."

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,768
Hey, sweetie. I made you a surprise.

194
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,799
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, tacos.

195
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,871
Ever since that story
I've had such a craving for them.

196
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,810
Did you not understand the story?

197
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,537
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

198
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,979
Nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

199
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,715
Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff?
You making dinner?

200
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,980
No.

201
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,052
What's over there? Tacos?

202
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,820
No. No.

203
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,727
They're just... They're
ground beef smileys.

204
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,899
Those are tacos.

205
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,540
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

206
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,107
Either way, I'll pass.
Still can't eat those.

207
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,649
What's so funny?

208
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,819
I'm not laughing.

209
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,795
You told her!

210
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,332
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

211
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,147
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!

212
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,113
It's not like I said,
"What would make this ride more fun?"

213
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,717
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

214
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,256
I should be
laying down papers for you.

215
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,927
- How could you?
- I had to. We're getting married.

216
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,532
Married couples can't keep secrets.

217
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,568
I guess Monica should know
about Atlantic City.

218
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,138
Dude!

219
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,139
- What happened?
- Chandler and I are in a bar...

220
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,642
Did you not hear me say, "Dude!"?

221
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,609
...and this girl
is making eyes at Chandler.

222
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:10,447
So he goes over to her and after
a minute or two I see them kissing.

223
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,951
Now, you're thinking "He's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girls."

224
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,126
And you're right.
He's not the type...

225
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,322
...to go to bars
and make out with girls.

226
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,833
You kissed a guy?

227
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,129
Oh, my God!

228
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,367
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

229
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,770
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...

230
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,513
So hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

231
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,947
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

232
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,961
Joey, do you think your favorite animal
says a lot about you?

233
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,559
No, because goats can't talk.

234
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,365
- Hi.
- Hey.

235
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,264
How's Hilda working out?

236
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:06,371
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

237
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,413
She happy she got the job?

238
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:13,845
My new assistant was very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

239
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,182
Hello.

240
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,651
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

241
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,828
It's the producers at Mac and Cheese,
if you'll excuse me for a minute.

242
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:29,762
Hey, funny you should call. I was
just looking over next week's script.

243
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,165
Canceled!

244
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,502
Like they're taking it off the air?

245
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,807
All right. I'll see you Monday.

246
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,140
We're not even shooting them anymore?

247
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,574
All right. Bye.

248
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,820
They canceled Mac and Cheese!

249
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,349
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Joey.

250
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,218
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?

251
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,436
You want to tell secrets?
Okay. In college...

252
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,573
...Ross used to wear leg warmers.

253
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,808
All right, Chandler entered a
Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and won.

254
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,576
Ross came in fourth and cried!

255
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,618
- I welled up.
- Oh, my God!

256
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,758
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

257
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,658
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too.

258
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,864
I already told him everything.
You shush!

259
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,964
Once she was sent to bed
without dinner...

260
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,072
...so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box she'd made.

261
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,280
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch Golden Girls.

262
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,117
Monica couldn't tell time
until she was 13.

263
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,280
It's hard for some people!

264
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,616
Of course it is.

265
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,724
Wow.

266
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,129
- Chandler wore my underwear to work once!
- Hey!

267
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,762
I'm sorry, I couldn't think
of any more for Ross.

268
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,661
In college, Chandler got drunk...

269
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,805
...and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm.

270
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,001
That was you.

271
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,406
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

272
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,582
I can't believe this!

273
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,787
Mac and Cheese was a great show.

274
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,954
How about that scene where Mac
teaches Cheese how to yodel? Come on!

275
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,755
Yeah, I actually liked that part.

276
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,021
How could this happen to me?

277
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,793
Yesterday I had two TV shows.
Today I got nothing.

278
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,801
Wait a minute,
what happened to Days of our Lives?

279
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,975
Well, they might be a little mad
at me over there.

280
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,575
What happened?

281
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:57,780
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
maybe I told them where they could go.

282
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,343
Joey, why would you do that?

283
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,951
Because! They wanted me to audition.

284
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,453
You? An actor? That's madness!

285
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,395
Rachel Green's office.

286
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,803
Tag.

287
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,469
Hi, who was that?

288
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,774
Nobody. I was just practicing.

289
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,201
Really?

290
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,346
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel Green's office.

291
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,545
You must be Hilda.

292
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,988
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?

293
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,318
Phoebe.

294
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,591
- That's a great name.
- Oh, you like that?

295
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,699
- You should hear my phone number.
- Okay. We'll be right back.

296
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,405
So you hired yourself
a little treat, did you?

297
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,838
I know how it looks,
but I am telling you...

298
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,477
You can't get involved
with your assistant.

299
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:07,242
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

300
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,978
But from now on,
I swear this is strictly professional.

301
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,587
- Yes.
- Hey, Rachel.

302
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,792
Hi.

303
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,459
Cute assistant. What's his story?

304
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,855
- Is he...
- Gay? Yeah.

305
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,636
Hey, Terry.

306
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,099
Joey Tribbiani.

307
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,832
Surprised your big head
could fit through our small halls.

308
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,036
- I gotta go, Joey.
- Wait, Terry! Look.

309
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,111
I'm really sorry about before.

310
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,374
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

311
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,745
- Give me another chance.
- I can't.

312
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,717
Wait, Terry, please!

313
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,784
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?

314
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,085
You have no idea how much I need this.

315
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,729
Please, help me out.

316
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,963
For old times' sake.

317
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,464
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeless.

318
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,536
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracle worker.

319
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,798
Here he comes.

320
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,007
Good morning.

321
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,353
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

322
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,520
And cut.

323
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,552
I'm back, baby!

324
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,703
You know, in my defense...

325
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,376
...there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

326
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,212
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

327
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,484
- Do you have trouble telling time now?
- No.

328
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,279
- Quick, what time is it?
- Time to kiss a guy?

329
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,955
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

330
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,199
You know when I said
married people...

331
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,230
...should share everything
and not have any secrets?

332
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,996
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was stupid. Let's not do that.

333
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,640
Absolutely.

334
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,403
- I'm on board.
- Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,282
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

336
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,314
Yeah, definitely.

337
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,551
Okay. If you'll excuse me...

338
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:28,759
...I'm gonna hang out with people who
don't know the Space Mountain story.

339
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,125
- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
- Man!

340
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,899
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

341
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,447
Hi.

342
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,049
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

343
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,951
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch...

344
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,849
...by guys.

345
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,184
- Really?
- Yeah.

346
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,720
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

347
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,195
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

348
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,996
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

349
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,974
Why is that?

350
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,176
- I don't think I should say.
- Oh, you can say.

351
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,407
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

352
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

353
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,853
- Well...
- Yeah.

354
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,489
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.

355
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,125
Yeah, she's gay.
