1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,569
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace...

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,238
...called Sample?

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:11,342
And as you're driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,669
"You're in Sample."

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,885
- How did it go with Pete?
- Tell us.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,384
You're not gonna believe this.
So I go...

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,623
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,862
- It's a little crowded. Do you mind?
- Could you scooch?

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,889
Move over just a little bit.

10
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,664
Keep on scooching.

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,729
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I'm...

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,965
Why? What is wrong with me?

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,006
- What's the matter?
- Tim...

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,006
...I have a feeling...

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,944
...my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

16
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,049
How do you know?

17
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,778
- He's got access.
- I know.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,359
It's a feeling you get.

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,923
Like when you're in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

20
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,562
That's the one.

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,132
- So you went to Pete's.
- What happened?

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,733
Why is this happening to me?

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,494
Maybe it's my wound.

24
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,667
Forget it.

25
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,174
It's not healed yet?

26
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,776
It's oozing!

27
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,712
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

28
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,346
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,319
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but I wanted it to come from me.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,284
- What is it?
- I've been sleeping with your wife.

31
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,548
You're the gynecologist?

32
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,487
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

33
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,198
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

34
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,765
Just give me the thing, all right?

35
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,740
Enough!
And you are no longer my friend!

36
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,942
We are finished! Nada!
No more!

37
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,143
You are a bastard for doing that!

38
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,878
Stay away from me!

39
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,705
Come back!

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,888
So, what were you gonna tell us?

41
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,224
I have no idea.

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,870
The One With the
Ultimate Fighting Champion

43
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,711
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

44
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,076
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

45
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,182
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

46
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,579
He didn't ask me to marry him.

47
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,222
Then definitely don't take his name!

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,196
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate...

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,193
...Fighting Competition thingy.

50
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,798
- Pete?
- Why? What is it?

51
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,626
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.

52
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,836
But without the costumes.

53
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,268
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.

54
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,775
It's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, "There are no rules"!

55
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,876
- I heard you made a great 12-year-old.
- It was the best year of my life.

56
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,578
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

57
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,087
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

58
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,759
- What's fish-hooking?
- What's fish-hook...?

59
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,401
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

60
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,269
What is that taste?

61
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,496
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.

62
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,912
Thanks for the warm welcome.

63
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:11,582
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play. I hope you do too.

64
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,252
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,045
There is no I in "team."

66
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:21,282
Yes, but there's two in "martini."
So, everybody, back to my office.

67
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,126
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

68
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,490
It's Bing, sir.
I'm sorry. I was just...

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,133
No, no. I heard what you said.
Funny. I like funny.

70
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,302
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

71
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,542
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

72
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,250
That's right. Ryder.

73
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,317
Winona Ryder for six.

74
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,857
Thank you.

75
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,424
Yeah. We have the reservations.

76
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,162
All right, buddy! Way to go!

77
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,231
Dude, what are you doing?

78
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,304
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like it's no big deal.

79
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,029
What'd you do about it?

80
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,038
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy...

81
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,144
...who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

82
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,279
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay
to be that guy.

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,718
Maybe it's that jock thing.

84
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,684
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

85
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,119
You know, I don't understand guys.

86
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,830
I mean, I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew...

87
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,330
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

88
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,364
I know. For a really great stew,
you'd just...

89
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,402
...stick your head in between them.

90
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,541
Can we please go eat?

91
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,871
- Yeah, what are we getting?
- Anything but stew.

92
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,351
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

93
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,313
Don't turn your back to him.

94
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,479
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

95
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:02,319
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

96
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,895
Then, when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

97
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,396
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

98
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,376
What if Joey was president?

99
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,144
Can I ask you something?

100
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,576
Okay, you can totally say no...

101
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,877
...but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date?

102
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,920
With who?

103
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,022
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute...

104
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,888
...and she asked if I could set it up.

105
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,895
- But if that's not cool...
- Which one is Bonnie?

106
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,602
You remember her from
my birthday party?

107
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,963
Average height...

108
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,400
...medium build, bald...

109
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,336
That's fine.

110
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,677
- Really?
- Ross and the bald girl? Absolutely.

111
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,150
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

112
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,625
You are iron! You are steel!

113
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,925
Let me ask you, how come when I call
your computer support line...

114
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,193
...I have to wait an hour and a half?

115
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,973
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

116
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,608
It's just hard when I know
I have e-mail I can't get.

117
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,915
- Hi.
- Monica.

118
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,949
- Hi, honey.
- On the table. On the table, please.

119
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,754
So listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about...

120
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,688
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

121
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,963
It sounds really dangerous.

122
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,257
I don't want you to get hurt
because I kind of like you.

123
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,960
I don't want to get hurt either.
I'm being smart about this.

124
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,230
See these guys? They're
the best trainers in the world.

125
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,341
And Hoshi here used to be
a paid assassin.

126
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,606
A house painter!
He used to be a house painter!

127
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,946
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- I promise.

128
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,213
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because...

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,186
...maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

130
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,085
No boom-boom before big fight!

131
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,530
How about just a boom?

132
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,536
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel...

133
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,833
...from one of the kids from Fame.

134
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,644
Ready to go to the movies?
Oh, this is Bonnie!

135
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:35,936
Hi!

136
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,175
This is Bonnie?

137
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,316
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,455
I can show you an ID. If you want.

139
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,717
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time I saw you.

140
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,828
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
started wearing bras again.

141
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,426
Oh, that must be it.

142
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,193
Have fun tonight.

143
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,596
Thanks. You too.

144
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,705
You said she was bald.

145
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,707
She was bald. She's not now.

146
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,612
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

147
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,786
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.

148
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,816
Oh, well, this is just perfect!

149
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,456
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.

150
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,222
I said it was okay when I thought
she was some weird bald chick.

151
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,932
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

152
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,564
- Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
- Does she have a bad personality?

153
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,969
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

154
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,206
Bing!

155
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,618
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

156
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,785
Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

157
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,953
Come on.

158
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,684
Oh, yeah! Good one.

159
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,490
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,827
- What is with him?
- "With him"?

161
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,501
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!

162
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,069
We never get smacked.

163
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,742
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

164
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,174
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

165
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,482
I'm telling you,
I need some smacks.

166
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,879
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

167
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,017
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

168
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,688
- You go to Dartmouth?
- No, sir.

169
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,491
There you go!

170
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,524
God, Ross! What is that?

171
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,465
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

172
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,798
I saved 30 cents.
Plus, I get to keep the cup.

173
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,410
From New York City, New York...

174
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,773
...appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut...

175
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,681
...he's known for his
confrontational business style!

176
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,389
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

177
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,025
...Pete Becker!

178
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,232
I love you, Pete!

179
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,269
And his opponent,
from Huntington Beach, California...

180
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,344
...he's a 300-pound
street fighter...

181
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,111
...Tank Abbott!

182
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,994
Pete? Pete?

183
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,627
- That guy's pretty huge.
- Don't worry.

184
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,368
I'll use his strength
and weight against him.

185
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,731
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

186
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,640
You go get him. Let's go!

187
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,743
Here we go, gentlemen.

188
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,279
Are you ready?

189
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,014
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

190
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,176
It's me.

191
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,076
Monica.

192
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,579
Who else would it be?

193
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,417
Earlier, when you were coming to,
you called me Fran.

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,256
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you?

195
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,490
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck!"

196
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,603
I thought you were nuts at first...

197
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,395
...but you did it.

198
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,967
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

199
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,609
Look back?

200
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,279
You're not gonna keep going?

201
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,347
Let me ask you a question:
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

202
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,150
Well, no. But...

203
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,688
I'm not gonna stop until I'm
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

204
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,561
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

205
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,925
Let me tell you a story.

206
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,166
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

207
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,840
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

208
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,010
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

209
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,612
And 862 others that I learned from.

210
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,717
Just like I learned from this fight,
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

211
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,013
You didn't know that already?

212
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,684
Look, I'm gonna get better.

213
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,452
Okay? I promise you.

214
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,564
Just get a lot better.

215
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,559
Fast.

216
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,629
One other thing.

217
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,706
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

218
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,867
Yeah.

219
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,343
That was the problem.

220
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,054
- How long until Pete's fight?
- About five minutes.

221
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,154
They're interviewing his opponent.

222
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,318
Apparently, he trains by going to Iran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

223
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,029
- Hot dog?
- Four, please.

224
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,092
I'm really nervous.

225
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,094
Thank you.

226
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,634
So, Ross, how did it go with Bonnie?

227
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,939
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

228
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,081
I actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

229
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,375
But she's really terrific.

230
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,554
It's too bad.

231
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,616
No, I'm saying I liked her.

232
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,726
There are other fish in the sea.

233
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,229
I think she's great, okay?
We're going out again.

234
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:05,135
I hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

235
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,806
Which one's my turkey burger?

236
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,301
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

237
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,538
- Fight's starting!
- We'll be right in.

238
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,748
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

239
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,974
Nine times.

240
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,845
I had to put on lotion.

241
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,788
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

242
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,027
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

243
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,889
Fight's over!

244
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,934
Excuse me, Doug?

245
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,408
Hey there, sports fan!

246
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,243
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

247
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,537
No. I didn't do them.

248
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,476
You forgot?

249
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,376
No, I just didn't do them.

250
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,112
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

251
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,051
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

252
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,884
...or otherwise.

253
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,621
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

254
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,332
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

255
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,563
That's okay. You're still
my number-one guy! Bing!

256
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,763
Doug!

257
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:20,134
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

258
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,904
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?

259
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,084
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

260
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,884
It's not about the swearing.
It's more about...

261
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,625
...the way that you occasionally...

262
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,328
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

263
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,326
...on my buttocks.

264
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,536
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the sentiment.

265
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,741
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.

266
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,741
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

267
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:00,077
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

268
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,116
Bing, you're okay.

269
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,991
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

270
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,736
...or inside his shower drain?

271
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,999
Oh, my God.

272
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,633
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

273
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,607
Look at that! It's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!

274
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,547
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

275
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,290
I hope he lets her down easy.

276
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,528
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

277
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,888
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

278
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,924
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

279
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,729
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

280
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,098
Oh, God!

281
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,902
It's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

282
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,340
You said it was okay.

283
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,640
You said she was bald!

284
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,478
Was! Was, was, was!

285
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,553
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

286
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:17,191
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

287
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,796
Okay, first of all, breathe.

288
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,364
Second of all, I don't get it.

289
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,867
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

290
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,136
Yes.

291
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:35,040
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

292
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,515
So?

293
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:49,150
It's just, you know, I didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

294
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,904
- Oh, no.
- What?

295
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,231
We killed them all!

296
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,255
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.

297
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,392
I'm not supposed to move my spine.

298
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,462
Please tell me you're stopping now.

299
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:31,225
I'm fine. I'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

300
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,837
Now, see this circle
I'm marking off here?

301
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,406
This is my Zone of Terror.

302
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:43,278
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

303
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,280
I can't until I'm
the ultimate fighter.

304
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,645
I will do it.

305
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,118
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight...

306
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,382
...me or Superman.

307
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,196
Not that I could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

308
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,694
Just sit down.

309
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,765
Please listen to me.

310
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,996
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst ultimate fighter ever.

311
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,566
Ever!

312
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,937
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm...

313
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,379
...and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

314
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,154
Well, then, you know what?

315
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,392
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

316
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,301
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

317
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,737
If you're asking me to quit...

318
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,803
...then you're asking me
to be someone I'm not.

319
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,666
I've got to do this.

320
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,813
Then I've gotta go.

321
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,541
Bye.

322
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,725
- Monica?
- Yes?

323
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,953
Could you leave a note?
I'm on painkillers...

324
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,459
...and I might not
remember this tomorrow.

325
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:17,831
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so I'm happy.

326
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,176
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

327
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,705
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

328
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,145
Goldberg, you maniac!

329
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,943
I love you!

330
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,055
- Couldn't have done it without you.
- Thank you, sir.

331
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,556
Oh, excuse me.

332
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,492
I forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

333
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,326
Of course, you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

334
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,269
Well, what about you?

335
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,840
You're not feeling left out, are you?

336
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,908
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

337
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,174
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

338
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,818
Yes, I do.

339
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,247
Now, get on out of here, you!

340
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,490
Pete Becker circles the ring.

341
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,132
Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.

342
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,834
- Bruiser is charging!
- Run.

343
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,630
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

344
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,833
I can't watch this.

345
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,702
Check it out! Pete's winning!

346
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,071
- Really?
- No!

347
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,983
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas
and is going for his favorite area!

348
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,689
Wait! If that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

349
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,518
This is ironic.

350
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,457
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

351
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,823
From the looks of it,
now Pete can't.
