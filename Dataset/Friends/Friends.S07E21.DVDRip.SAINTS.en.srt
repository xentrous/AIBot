1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,636
Do you realize we're getting
married in four weeks?

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,671
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,471
Do you realize you get
louder each week?

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,782
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows yet?

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:21,283
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:25,253
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to the wedding.

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:31,360
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,529
Do you happen to know exactly
what I'm gonna say?

9
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,503
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,536
Say what's in your heart.

11
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,473
Look at her go. She must love me
more than I love her!

12
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,054
What's wrong with me?
Don't open that door.

13
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:01,518
The One With The Vows

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,964
"Monica, there are no words..."

15
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,563
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

16
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,505
You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,874
With Carol, I promised never to love
another woman until the day I die.

18
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,843
She made no such promise.

19
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm so pathetic. Monica knows what to
say. You should have seen her writing.

20
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,552
What's the emergency?

21
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,661
You have to help me. I'm supposed
to write my vows and all I have is this.

22
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:14,425
I like the pretty drawing of you
in the wedding dress.

23
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,327
Except your breasts look kind of small.

24
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,535
Those are my eyes!

25
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,668
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

26
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,483
Why don't you just start
with something simple, like:

27
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:38,646
"Monica, from the moment I met you,
I knew I loved you."

28
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,485
I'm not sure I can do that.

29
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,127
Everyone, this is Chandler.

30
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,297
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

31
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,531
Okay.

32
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,066
Okay, okay.
Maybe you could start with:

33
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,037
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

34
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,372
...there was a part of me
that always knew I wanted more."

35
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,107
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

36
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,449
Would you go out with me?

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,489
Are we allowed to lie in the vows?

38
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,159
Maybe you don't talk about
your feelings back then.

39
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:22,357
Just say something about all the things
that he's taught you, like...

40
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,599
Or all the things you taught him.

41
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,270
Everybody knows
the basic erogenous zones.

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,447
You got one, two, three...

43
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,843
...four, five...

44
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,042
...six and seven.

45
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,249
There are seven?

46
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,024
- That's one?
- Kind of an important one.

47
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,055
I was looking at it upside down.

48
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,357
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,800
Okay, now, start out
with a little one...

50
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,706
...a two, a one-two-three...

51
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,945
...a three, a five...

52
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,613
...a four, a three-two...

53
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,755
...two, a two-four-six.

54
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,182
Two-four-six, four, two...

55
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,921
...two, four-seven...

56
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,592
...five-seven, six-seven...

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,166
...seven, seven...

58
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,600
...seven, seven, seven, seven, seven...

59
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,137
...seven!

60
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,574
I got it!
How about saying something like:

61
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:50,278
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

62
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,826
- Yeah?
- I can't do everything.

63
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,260
Look back over your time together.

64
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,634
Oh, look, twins!

65
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,567
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

66
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,465
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

67
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,905
I'll tell you what.

68
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:17,242
When we're 40, if neither of us are married,
what do you say you and I have one?

69
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,181
Why wouldn't I be married
when I'm 40?

70
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,377
Oh, no. No, I just
meant hypothetically.

71
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,489
Hypothetically, why won't I
be married when I'm 40?

72
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,749
No, no.

73
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,453
What is it? Seriously, is there something
fundamentally un-marriable about me?

74
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,655
Well?

75
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,926
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

76
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,567
I'm getting married today!

77
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,877
Do you think he knew I was here?

78
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,809
Nice try.

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,749
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

80
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,784
Look, Monica...

81
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,395
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this will work.

82
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,966
You are so great! I love you.

83
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,446
What?

84
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,519
Nothing! I said, you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

85
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,588
- You said you love me! I can't believe this.
- No, I didn't.

86
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,731
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

87
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,170
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

88
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,066
Stop it! Stop it!

89
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:55,045
You know, I was thinking,
what if I unpack here?

90
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,539
Then all your stuff would be here.

91
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,313
Well...

92
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,617
What if all my stuff was here?

93
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,124
Then you'd be going back and forth
all the time.

94
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,219
Doesn't make any sense.

95
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,163
Okay.

96
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,164
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

97
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,611
You wanted it to be a surprise.

98
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,957
Oh, my God!

99
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,789
Chandler...

100
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,763
...in all my life...

101
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,199
...I never thought
I would be so lucky...

102
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,977
...as to fall in love with my best...

103
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,905
My best...

104
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,581
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
- Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

105
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,383
I thought...

106
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,028
I can do this.

107
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,200
I thought...

108
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:27,395
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

109
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,000
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

110
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:41,047
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

111
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,684
And if you let me...

112
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,462
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

113
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,503
Monica?

114
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,907
Will you marry me?

115
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,604
Yes.

116
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,627
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

117
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,290
Come in! Come in!

118
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,629
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

119
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,034
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

120
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,510
We were helping Chandler write
his vows, but he kicked us out...

121
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,276
...because Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

122
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,882
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass"
inappropriate?

123
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,215
How's Monica doing?

124
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,191
Let's say it's lucky she's got a sweet ass
because she's not so good at the writing.

125
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,262
I can't believe in four weeks
they're gonna be married!

126
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,502
Let's just hope it works.

127
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,365
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

128
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,040
Phoebe, that's not true.

129
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,334
Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?

130
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,271
I can't believe they've
been together 3 years.

131
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,706
That long?

132
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,180
Maybe it seems like less because
they hid it from us for so long.

133
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,687
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

134
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,453
I've had a very long, hard day.

135
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,624
- I'm gonna get some chicken. Want some?
- No, thanks. No, chicken. Bye, then.

136
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,767
Are you okay? I'm sorry. He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

137
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,172
Chicken?

138
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,943
I could eat some chicken.

139
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,715
Hey, Joe!

140
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,985
Can I get a three-piece, some coleslaw
and some beans and a Coke?

141
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,290
Diet Coke.

142
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:09,360
- I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
- It's not like we weren't cool about it.

143
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,332
You? And you?

144
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,539
You cannot tell. No one knows.

145
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,436
How? When?

146
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,946
- It happened in London.
- In London?!

147
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,409
We didn't tell anyone, because we didn't
want to make a big deal out of it.

148
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,711
But it is a big deal!

149
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,486
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

150
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,219
- You can't.
- Please!

151
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:38,363
We don't want to deal with telling
everyone. Just promise you won't tell.

152
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,131
All right!

153
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,001
I can't wait to be with you. I'll tell
Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours.

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,970
Laundry? Is that my new nickname?

155
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,006
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...

156
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,421
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

157
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,765
Chandler and Monica!
Chandler and Monica!

158
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,368
Oh, my God!

159
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,335
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

160
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,066
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

161
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,869
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,207
I know! I know!

163
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,747
- You know?
- Yes, I know!

164
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,476
And Joey knows, but Ross doesn't know,
so you have to stop screaming!

165
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,713
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi!

166
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,651
What? What?

167
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,761
Oh, God! We're just so excited that
you might get this apartment!

168
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,326
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

169
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,128
Get in here! Come on!

170
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,338
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?

171
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,408
Yes, but you know what? It
doesn't matter who knows what.

172
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,810
Now enough of us know,
that we can just tell them we know.

173
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,747
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

174
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,355
Or we could not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

175
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,659
All right, we better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

176
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,991
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,720
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

178
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,701
Did you see that? With the
inappropriate and the pinching?

179
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:28,931
Actually, I did.

180
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,406
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

181
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,480
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she knows about us!

182
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,913
- Phoebe knows about us!
- Well, I didn't tell them.

183
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,880
Them? Who's them?

184
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,489
Phoebe and Joey.

185
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,452
Joey!

186
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:50,994
And Rachel.

187
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,126
I would've told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

188
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,632
Oh, man. They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

189
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,829
But, see, they don't know that we know
that they know.

190
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,072
- So...
- Ah, yes!

191
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,074
The messers become the messees!

192
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:12,277
Oh, my God, he wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

193
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,576
Are you kidding?

194
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,186
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

195
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,259
Joey? Do they know that we know?

196
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,893
- No.
- Joey!

197
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,603
- They know you know.
- I knew it!

198
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,597
I cannot believe those two!

199
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,538
They thought that they could mess with
us? They're trying to mess with us?

200
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,878
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

201
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,049
Joey, you can't say anything.

202
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,119
Couldn't if I wanted to.

203
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,926
This is getting out of hand!
She wants me to put lotion on her!

204
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,389
She's bluffing!

205
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,825
She's not backing down.
She went like this:

206
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,564
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

207
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,238
Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?

208
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,344
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler,
the sooner this is all over and in the open.

209
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,877
- I like that.
- Okay.

210
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,576
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

211
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,287
Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons.

212
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,986
It's not my first time.

213
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,768
You go back out there
and seduce her till she cracks.

214
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,663
Okay, give me a second.

215
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,272
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

216
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,141
Oh, you're going?

217
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,448
Not without you, lover.

218
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,348
So this is my bra.

219
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,787
It's very, very nice.

220
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,229
Well, come here.

221
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,195
I'm very happy
we're gonna have all the sex.

222
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,004
You should be. I'm very bendy.

223
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,810
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.

224
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,102
I guess there's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

225
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,705
Here it comes.

226
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,166
Our first kiss.

227
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,120
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

228
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,984
- I can't have sex with you.
- Why not?

229
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,819
- Because I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

230
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,099
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

231
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,301
I love you, Monica.

232
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,267
I love you too, Chandler.

233
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,747
I thought you guys were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love.

234
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,289
So that's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

235
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,290
- Well, actually, Ross doesn't.
- We'd appreciate if no one told him yet.

236
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,892
No.

237
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,329
What are you doing?

238
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,696
Get off my sister!

239
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,139
Your friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

240
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,004
You think it'll be that different?

241
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:02,146
How could it not be?
Soon, they're gonna have kids...

242
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,544
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

243
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,015
And maybe they'll leave the city...

244
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,087
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

245
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,350
Things change.

246
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,687
But I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

247
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,698
It'll be okay, Joe.

248
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,793
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

249
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,330
Who's this little naked guy?

250
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,565
That little naked guy would be me.

251
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,772
Look at the little thing.

252
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,344
Yes.

253
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,647
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

254
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,621
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

255
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,050
That's Nana right there in the middle.

256
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,523
- Wow.
- Let's see.

257
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,322
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

258
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,932
Monica, you look like your grandmother.
How old was she there?

259
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,962
Let's see, 1939.

260
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,161
Yeah, 24, 25.

261
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,098
Looks like a fun gang.

262
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,873
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

263
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,847
Let me see.

264
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,352
No, that would be me again.

265
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,394
- Hey, you guys.
- What's going on?

266
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,997
Well, we were just talking about...

267
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,327
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

268
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,371
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

269
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,941
That's so sweet.

270
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,873
- So we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

271
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,482
Just as long as I don't hear Chandler's
and he doesn't hear mine.

272
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,125
Oh, that's beautiful.

273
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,887
Funny one! That's good!

274
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,458
Monica, will you marry me?

275
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,035
What? I don't get it.

276
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,930
Oh, yeah!

277
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,069
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

278
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,749
Don't worry, honey.
We'll make yours funnier.

279
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,288
Okay, what do you guys think?

280
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,827
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

281
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,134
- You really like it?
- Dude!

282
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,197
How did you write this?

283
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,873
I stole Monica's
and changed the name.

284
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,474
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first, he can!
