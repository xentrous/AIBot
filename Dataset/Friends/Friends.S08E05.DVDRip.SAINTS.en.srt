1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,560
This one's rare.
This one's medium-well. Go!

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,560
Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,200
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,400
-Well, hello there.
-Hi.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,160
I didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,240
Tim, this is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,720
-So you're Monica's boss?
-No, she's my boss.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,480
-"Sous" is French for "under."
-I "sous-stand."

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,560
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,200
-You made pesto?
-Yes, I did.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o?

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,840
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,200
I still need the calamari and salad.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
I like your necklace.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,800
"Coming up, Monica. I have to obey you,
otherwise the system breaks down."

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,160
"I know that." "Then why are
we having this conversation? "

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,720
-I made it myself.
-You are so talented.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, it's no pesto.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,280
Let's just cut to the chase.
You're single. You're single.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,200
He gets off work at 11.
She'll be waiting for your call.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,200
I'll give him your number if I could just
get one calamari and one caesar salad!

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,720
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,920
-Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
-You know me, sir.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,040
Do you know how I can get around
the office computer network..

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,120
so I can access
the really good Internet porn?

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,400
You're a joker, Bing.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,760
What's funny about that?

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
-Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
-That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,200
I think you know where I wanna go.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,800
-The Hard Rock Cafe?
-Yeah.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
-Again?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,840
-I'm telling you, I like the food.
-You like the Purple Rain display.

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,600
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,280
-Did that guy just call you Toby?
-Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,120
-Why don't you correct him?
-It's been going on way too long now.

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,760
The first time, we were just passing
each other, so I didn't say anything.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,160
The next time he said,
"Toby, want a doughnut?"

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,920
I wanted the doughnut.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,560
-Chandler, you have to tell him.
-That would be so awkward.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,920
We don't work together.
He's on the sixth floor.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,960
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,760
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,480
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,120
Oh, my God.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,160
Chandler "M." Bing.

47
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,960
It's not just an "M."
Your middle name is Muriel!

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,720
It is a family name.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,560
Chandler Muriel Bing.

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,160
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your memory loss.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
What is it?

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,480
Your brain transplant
wasn't successful.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,680
Is it serious?

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body..

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,160
and synthesize antibodies
to stop you from rejecting the brain.

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,880
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,760
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body..

60
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,160
it was gone.

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
Very nice, people.

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,840
I'll change and we can go.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,400
-What happened to Jessica's body?
-You'll have to see it on TV.

64
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,520
-You don't know, do you?
-Couldn't care less.

65
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,520
-Good scene, man.
-You too.

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,720
What? You weren't in it.

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash.

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,640
-Hi.
-Why haven't I seen you here before?

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,520
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

70
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,920
Which I'm not.
I'm not.

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,720
And your dog's name is Wally.

73
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,120
-Look, I'm just stroking your arm.
-Here we go.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,240
Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

75
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,360
-Monica.
-Hi.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,360
I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

77
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,160
I can't wait
to get "sous-neath" him.

78
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,960
-I have to fire him.
-Why?

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,360
He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,200
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,560
He was nervous.
You can be intimidating.

82
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,440
And your pastry chef can stand
to be taken down a peg.

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,160
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,520
But, Monica, he loves his job so much.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,320
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,720
All right. But if he lights
someone else on fire, he's gone.

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,440
That's fair. Thank you so much.

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,200
Looks like he got you
a little bit too.

89
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
I paid to have this done.

90
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,520
Love it!

91
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,360
Hey. You know,
Kash really liked you.

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,560
He thought you were charming.

93
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,640
-I thought I was an idiot.
-I'm with you.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,920
-He asked if you'd go out with him.
-I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

95
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,160
-What did you say?
-"No."

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,160
What?

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,320
I figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

98
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,760
First of all, Kash Ford?
Not people.

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,400
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

100
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,160
No. I didn't know if you told people.
This was when Kash was still "people."

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,000
-Good. Just have him call me.
-I don't think that's..

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,720
Go do it or I'll come back
to that set. I'll meet more actors.

103
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,920
-Hey, Bob.
-How's my pal Toby doing today?

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,920
If I see him, I'll ask.

105
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,280
Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

106
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,120
-Yeah.
-You know him?

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,720
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,560
-What about adding him to our team?
-Bob?

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,480
Working here with us? Every day?
I don't know if he has what it takes.

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,320
-They love him down on six.
-But this is 11.

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,560
It's almost twice as hard up here.

112
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,560
-Okay, Bob will stay put.
-I think it's best, sir.

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,320
We do need to find somebody.
Work is starting to pile up.

114
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,560
I've got a stack
of documents this high.

115
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,960
Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.

116
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,000
That's a good one, Bing.

117
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,880
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
I gave him another chance,
but Tim has got to go.

119
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,720
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

120
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,120
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

121
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,000
-But don't fire him today.
-Why?

122
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
-Because I'm dumping him today.
-You said he was sweet.

123
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,840
He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

124
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,480
"Did you get home okay?
Was your shower okay?"

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
-Don't pick up the phone.
-Then he comes over!

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,760
"I was so worried about you."
Be a man!

127
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
So I can't fire him?

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,520
And dump him the same day?
He'll kill himself.

129
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,080
I'll fire him, and you go out
with him another week.

130
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.

131
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,360
We'll both do it today
and he'll just have to deal with it.

132
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,520
Okay. But who's gonna go first?
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,760
-What?
-Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

134
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Bitch!
And dump a guy that's just been fired?

135
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
Blond bitch!

136
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,960
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.

137
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
All right, that makes sense.

138
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,520
But screw you! I'm going first!

139
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,000
-Toby, you got a sec?
-Sure. What's up?

140
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,920
I wanted to get transferred up here,
but it's not gonna happen.

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,320
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "11th-floor material."

142
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,520
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

143
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,240
What's the best excuse for why
I'm not drinking on this date tonight?

144
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,320
"I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"..

145
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,760
or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?

146
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,760
You're not gonna
tell him you're pregnant?

147
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,360
I don't think so. Books say wait
till the third date to tell the guy..

148
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,520
you got something
growing in your uterus.

149
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
-Hey.
-Hi.

150
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,880
What do you want to do tonight?

151
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,040
There's a powerful Ukrainian film
playing. Interested?

152
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,440
No. But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,600
-Rach, you wanna come?
-I can't. I've got a date.

154
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,320
-A date?
-Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

155
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,120
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's regular.

156
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,320
It's mundane.
It's actually a little dull.

157
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,320
It's no Ukrainian film.

158
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Earrings!

159
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,800
-She's got a date? With who?
-I set her up with this actor.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,520
-You set her up?
-No.

161
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,840
-What were you thinking?
-That it was okay..

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,840
because you two haven't dated
in five years.

163
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm worried about my baby.
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

164
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,400
-Where is this "actor" taking them?
-Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

165
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,080
They're taking the ferry
to a place on Staten Island.

166
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,200
My baby's going on a ferry? Do you
have any idea how dangerous those are?

167
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,360
Aren't we talking about
those big boats that go really slow?

168
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,240
Why not just jump out of an airplane
or burn each other with matches?

169
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,600
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

170
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,040
Hey, I hear you're going
on a ferry tonight.

171
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,480
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

172
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,440
Do you guys think this is too slutty?
Hi, Kash.

173
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,200
-Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
-Yeah. See you guys later.

174
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
Have a great time, you guys.
And yes, it is too slutty!

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,920
Hi.

176
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Hi.

177
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm glad you called.
I feel like I'm always calling you.

178
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,040
What's up?
Is everything okay with Phoebe?

179
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,560
It will be in a minute.

180
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,280
-Tim, you're a really great guy.
-That's because I'm with you.

181
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,640
It's just, I'm in a place in my life
right now where..

182
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,680
So sorry. "This just in."

183
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,360
It's the restaurant.
Monica needs me right away.

184
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,080
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

185
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,080
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

186
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,880
And I will be holding you right here.

187
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,280
What movie do you wanna see?
And not one I have to read.

188
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
I get that from books.

189
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,840
-Books?
-Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes..

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
but it's enough!

191
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,560
Let's not see a movie.
We'll just stay here and hang.

192
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,880
-Just wait for Rachel to come back?
-Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

193
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,520
Dude, what is going on?

194
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,920
-I have to find out how it went.
-Why?

195
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,200
-He could be my baby's stepfather.
-One date and they're getting married?

196
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,680
He's not you!

197
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
I can't believe she's dating!

198
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,920
-What did you think she was gonna do?
-I don't know.

199
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,640
-I can't believe this is happening.
-What do you mean?

200
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,080
I thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.

201
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,120
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's..

202
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,080
it breaks my heart a little.

203
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,880
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed..

204
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,720
my kid comes running in, leaps up
on the bed and we all read the paper.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,080
Maybe fight over the science section.

206
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,720
-That's nice. You can still have that.
-No. Rachel's out with some guy.

207
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
My baby went with her.

208
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,680
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

209
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,680
Hey, can I ask you something?

210
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,920
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

211
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,080
It used to be.

212
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,480
Now she doesn't really have a face.

213
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,840
Smokin' body, though.

214
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,280
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

215
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,360
No. But how much easier would it be
if it were?

216
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,600
That's not what she wants.

217
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,680
I know. And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her.

218
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,080
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

219
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,040
It won't be what you thought.
But no matter what..

220
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,720
there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

221
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,280
Who cares what the picture looks like?

222
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Yeah.

223
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,320
Let's you and me go out
and have some fun.

224
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,080
Whatever you want. Come on.

225
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,120
-We can catch that Ukrainian film.
-No, I said fun.

226
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,680
-Hey, Toby?
-Hey, Bobby.

227
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,680
It's Bob, actually.

228
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,880
You work up here. Where's
Chandler Bing's office?

229
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,680
Yeah, it's right..

230
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,520
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

231
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,080
I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

232
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay, Bob. Listen.

233
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

234
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,560
-Toby, don't.
-Bob.

235
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,160
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover
for him.

236
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,520
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

237
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,960
That puts me
in a difficult position.

238
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,840
You do anything to Chandler,
it's gonna bring you down to his level.

239
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,640
I guess you're right.

240
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,960
Don't give him the satisfaction.
You're better than Chandler. We all are.

241
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,520
Especially me, Toby.

242
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
-Is everything okay?
-That depends.

243
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,560
-How are you and Phoebe?
-Great. Thanks for introducing us.

244
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,640
My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

245
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,760
-Phoebe!
-Monica!

246
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,920
-You're fired!
-I'm breaking up with you!

247
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm breaking up with you.

248
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,320
-You're fired.
-Why?

249
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

250
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm sorry too.
But I like things done a certain way.

251
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,280
-The chemistry's just not right.
-The chemistry thing for us too.

252
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,440
Wow. Okay.

253
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,600
I realize I came on a little strong.
It's because I think you're amazing.

254
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,840
I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity.

255
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,440
You're the most talented chef
I've ever worked for.

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,840
Anyway..

257
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,040
-Tim, wait.
-Yeah?

258
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,840
I spoke too quickly. There's
a learning curve with this job.

259
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,560
Maybe we could try it again.

260
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,240
Thank you so much.
I know I can be better.

261
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And, Tim, I just want to say
good luck here.

262
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,000
-Hello.
-Hi.

263
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,520
How was the date?

264
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm alone and I just bought $15 worth
of candy bars. What do you think?

265
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,480
-What happened?
-I told him I was pregnant.

266
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,240
-He didn't take it so well?
-Well, better than you.

267
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,560
-But still not what you want.
-Oh?

268
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,240
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said:

269
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,320
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."

270
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
-He sounds swell.
-Doesn't he?

271
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,640
You want a little cheering up?
Sit down.

272
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.

273
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,000
Chandler M. Bing.
Oh, my God.

274
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,640
-I'm sorry about your date.
-It's all right.

275
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,160
I guess I'm just done
with the dating thing.

276
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
Just one more thing in my life
that's completely different.

277
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,640
-This is hard.
-Yeah, I know.

278
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,360
On the other hand, in seven months
you're gonna have something..

279
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,240
that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

280
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,200
Just wait.

281
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,680
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

282
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,200
You have no idea.

283
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,000
Thanks, sweetie.

284
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,280
-You wanna grab some coffee?
-No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

285
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,040
-I thought I cheered you up.
-You did. There are 20 in here.

286
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,240
-Good night.
-Good night.

287
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
Ross? Hey, it's Mona.
From the wedding.

288
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,640
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

289
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,680
-How are you?
-I'm good, except you owe me a dance.

290
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,480
That's right. Well, would you be
interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?

291
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,440
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

292
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,440
Great. Well..

293
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,920
-I think I need another cup of coffee.
-Sure, let me get it for you.

294
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,240
Bob?

295
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,840
Bob!

296
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,720
Bob!

297
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
-What the hell are you doing?
-This is Chandler's office.

298
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,040
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
