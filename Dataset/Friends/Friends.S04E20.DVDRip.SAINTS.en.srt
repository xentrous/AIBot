1
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,705
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,207
Joey?

3
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,042
Did I wake you?

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,305
The One with
All the Wedding Dresses

5
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,428
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

6
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,926
So what do you do when
you're not working here?

7
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,664
-You don't need to fill these silences.
-Okay, thanks.

8
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,975
That's your fourth cup of coffee.

9
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:56,138
Okay, do me.
I've had a certain number of juices.

10
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,049
I'm exhausted because
Joey started snoring.

11
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,382
He's in a different room.
He's that loud?

12
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,853
You should hear me.

13
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,857
It's nothing to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

14
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,658
I'm not going to any clinic.

15
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,495
I don't have a problem.
You have the problem.

16
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,730
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

17
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,907
-They don't have those.
-Yeah, they do.

18
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,202
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

19
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,005
There, you just had your first class.

20
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,180
I used to date a light sleeper.

21
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,681
Whenever I snored,
he rolled me over

22
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,548
Oh, yeah!

23
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,417
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

24
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,356
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

25
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,891
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

26
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,864
Hey, guys.

27
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,765
Oh, the Olympics!

28
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,248
-Have you picked a date?
-No. Not yet.

29
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,746
I still cannot believe
you're engaged.

30
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,585
Because it's so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,682
Thanks. Has anyone seen Rach?

32
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,895
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.

33
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,566
I won't do them this time.
Even if they sit there until...

34
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,327
I'll do them when I get home.

35
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,636
Emily found this
wedding dress in London

36
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,071
-Already?
-But it didn't fit.

37
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,772
There's a store here with one left in her size.
But the groom can't see

38
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,813
-I'll pick it up for you.
-Thanks.

39
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:42,248
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses...

40
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,922
Wah-pah!

41
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,322
What's wah-pah?

42
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,524
You know. Whipped.

43
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,025
Wah-pah!

44
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,765
That's not whipped.

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,767
Whipped is...

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,564
That's what I did.

47
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,746
You can't do anything!

48
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,892
Hey, Mon.
I was just doing these dishes.

49
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,961
Do you have a minute?

50
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,138
I was just about to
take a break anyway.

51
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,331
So listen...

52
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,175
...I know we haven't had
a chance to talk...

53
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,313
...since Emily and I
decided to get married.

54
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,211
And I was just wondering
how you were.

55
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:52,481
If you were getting married,
I would feel kind of...

56
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,021
You know?

57
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,457
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know...

58
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,392
...I'm okay.

59
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,966
I just wanted to check.

60
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,165
That's sweet. Thank you.

61
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,899
You're great.

62
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,637
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

63
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,546
You just hang in there.

64
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,747
"Hang in there"?

65
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,752
No, I didn't mean...

66
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:30,361
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

67
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,396
I thought you had
just been on four dates.

68
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,468
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

69
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,770
Oh no, it has become.

70
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,575
Oh no, those were four great dates.

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,278
I mean, and the connection!

72
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,815
Emotionally, mentally.
You know?

73
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,816
Physically.

74
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,724
-That's incredible.
-I know, isn't it?

75
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,451
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

76
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,893
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

77
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,971
I gotta get back to my dishes.

78
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,604
I gotta get to work.

79
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,605
You know what would
make me happy?

80
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,476
You know, what's that?

81
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,652
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

82
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,153
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

83
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,917
Why don't we all
have dinner Sunday night?

84
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,986
That would be great!

85
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,964
All right. It's a date!

86
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,268
"Hang in there."
You hang in there.

87
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,932
-Did you say something?
-No, just singing.

88
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,315
Oh, my God!

89
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,348
Look at this one!

90
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,219
It's so beautiful.

91
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,120
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

92
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,460
May I help you ladies?

93
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,155
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,697
What's the name?

95
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,903
-Emily Waltham.
-Yes, I have it right here.

96
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,874
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

97
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,521
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

98
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,325
I am, aren't I?

99
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,498
Miss Waltham?

100
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,725
We're closing.

101
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,533
All right.

102
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,176
And could I get my ring back?

103
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,413
All right, buddy.
Time to roll over.

104
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,929
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

105
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,367
And a pajama store!

106
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,935
Does she use the cups?

107
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,373
Yes, I believe she does.

108
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,749
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

109
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:50,985
Thank you.

110
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,298
Thank you very much.

111
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,229
Thank you for coming.

112
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,669
-Just a second.
-No, no! Let me in!

113
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,407
Can you hold on a minute?

114
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,412
No! You have to
let me in right now!

115
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,074
Are you alone?

116
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,182
All right.

117
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,622
This sucks.

118
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,159
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

119
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,801
I'm so tired.

120
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,432
It's six o'clock.

121
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,811
I hear you and Joshua are
going out with Ross and Emily.

122
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,141
I think that's really cool.

123
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,614
I think you're handling
that really well.

124
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,783
"Handling it"?

125
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,314
There's nothing to handle.

126
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,961
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

127
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,028
They're not going to
get married anyway.

128
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,768
They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

129
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,803
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

130
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,736
One of them will realize
what they've done...

131
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,238
...and call it off.

132
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,913
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

133
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,172
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

134
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,706
Why not?

135
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,148
Weddings are a great place
to meet women.

136
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,254
When I dance, I look like this.

137
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,598
Hey, man.

138
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,003
What are you doing
four weeks from today?

139
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,467
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

140
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,005
I am...

141
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,066
...free.

142
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,105
Because we're getting
married in a month.

143
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,281
-What?
-Yes.

144
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,749
In a month?

145
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,218
-You mean 30 days?
-Yeah.

146
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,347
From now?

147
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,051
That's great!

148
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,362
She always wanted to get married
where her parents did...

149
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,965
...but it's getting torn down.

150
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,035
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

151
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,967
...and it just feels right.

152
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,977
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

153
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,484
This isn't mine.

154
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,467
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

155
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,627
What's up?

156
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,441
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

157
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,873
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.

158
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,772
See you and hug you.

159
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,277
See you...

160
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,778
Great!

161
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,613
Sit.

162
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,219
You okay?

163
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:11,793
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

164
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,559
Want to know why?

165
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,694
Do I?

166
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,766
Because I am really happy about us.

167
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,137
I think we are so
on the right track.

168
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,574
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

169
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,873
-You know?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

170
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,744
We're clicking.

171
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,453
If there was just
one little area where...

172
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,589
...I think we need to work on,
I would think...

173
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,282
...it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

174
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,057
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

175
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,959
You know, yeah, you're right.

176
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,897
We have our fun. Yeah?

177
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,535
I mean, like crazy!
You know?

178
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,706
Are you gonna put on
that cheerleader outfit again?

179
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,146
No. You wish.

180
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,449
All right.

181
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,824
This is going to sound, you know,
a little hasty.

182
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,824
But just go with me.

183
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,830
What if we got married?

184
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,999
-What?
-Oh, I know. It's so totally like...

185
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,302
..."Whoa, can we do this?"
You know?

186
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,879
But it just feels right.
Don't you think it does?

187
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,812
I mean, it just feels right.
Don't you...?

188
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,113
Rachel...

189
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,884
...you're...

190
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,184
...a real...

191
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,260
...special lady.

192
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,763
But my divorce isn't final yet...

193
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,163
...and we've been on four dates.

194
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,272
So I'm thinking: No...

195
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,672
...but...

196
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,135
...thanks.

197
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,173
You idiot!

198
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,814
-Your name, please?
-Joey Tribbiani.

199
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,952
Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

200
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:24,985
Sir?

201
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,532
Yes, he did.

202
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,828
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

203
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,871
Check out that girl.
She's really hot.

204
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,345
Yeah, she is.

205
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,184
How you doing?

206
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,117
You looking good.

207
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,822
-What?
-You're coming on to the entire room.

208
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,430
-I'm Chandler.
-I'm Marjorie.

209
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,403
-Do you mind if I sit?
-Please.

210
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,109
So what are you in for?

211
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,800
I talk in my sleep.

212
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,214
What a coincidence!
I listen in my sleep.

213
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,478
So why don't you give me your number?

214
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,288
Are you ready?

215
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,116
I got it! Mine!

216
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,791
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

217
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,227
My turn, my turn!

218
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,264
Okay, ready?

219
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,307
That was a terrible throw!

220
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,179
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

221
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,914
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

222
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,094
Oh, my God!

223
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,763
We're really sad, aren't we?

224
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,998
Yeah, I think we are.

225
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,400
This isn't even my dress.

226
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:20,668
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late."

227
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,516
-I'm changing out of this.
-Me, too.

228
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,847
In half an hour?

229
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,248
Me, too.

230
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,154
All right, now throw it
straight this time.

231
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,755
I'm getting married!

232
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,202
I hate my regular clothes now.

233
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,236
I look down and I know...

234
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,902
...this won't be the most
special day of my life.

235
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,449
I mean, it was kind of
fun for a while...

236
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,708
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

237
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,216
I guess.

238
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,556
Oh, my God!

239
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,817
You're such a cheater!

240
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,153
Hello, little ones.

241
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,395
-So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
-Yep!

242
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,501
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

243
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,470
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, you know, she picked me.

244
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,301
How'd that happen?

245
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,535
Because I'm cooler.

246
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:29,836
No, seriously.

247
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,712
She's the kind of girl...
Joey was unconscious.

248
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,854
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?

249
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,056
Oh, my God!

250
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,418
What is that?

251
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,190
They gave it to me
at the sleep clinic...

252
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,129
...and it's going to help me
not to snore.

253
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,371
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

254
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,274
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

255
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,374
I know I don't have to.

256
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,611
It tastes good.

257
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,179
Plus, you look cool.

258
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,021
Hope I didn't stretch Emily's dress.

259
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,686
Your butt's not
that much bigger than her's.

260
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,789
I just called Joshua.

261
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,329
How'd it go?

262
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,163
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

263
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,930
...some crazy girl who's
dying to get married.

264
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,903
And I'm going through
a hard time.

265
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,065
What'd he say?

266
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,078
His answering machine
was very understanding.

267
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,847
I feel blue.

268
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,853
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

269
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:50,050
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

270
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,193
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

271
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,268
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

272
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,334
But as it turns out...

273
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,734
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

274
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,168
Yeah, maybe.

275
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,338
And I'm just trying to
figure out why.

276
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,505
Any luck?

277
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:17,013
You know how Ross and I have
always been on-again, off-again?

278
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,253
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

279
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,427
...we would be on again.

280
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,855
Again.

281
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,529
You know what?
I think we all did.

282
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,540
I got us reservations
for Sunday night.

283
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,441
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

284
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,742
Well, you'd better make it for three.

285
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,818
I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at three.

286
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,122
Three people.

287
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,584
Joshua's not going to be there.

288
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,886
What happened?

289
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,496
Well, I think he broke up with me.

290
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,728
No. Why?

291
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,831
Apparently, he scares easy.

292
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,334
Rachel, I'm sorry.

293
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,938
It's okay.

294
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:18,349
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

295
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,317
Come here.

296
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,955
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?

297
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,035
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I got my girls.

298
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,048
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

299
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,114
What?

300
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,626
I got to tell you...

301
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,733
...this really does put me
in a better mood.

302
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,067
I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

303
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,075
Maybe someday there will be.

304
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,078
Chandler's coming by to borrow
candles for his big date.

305
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,114
Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

306
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,310
The groom cannot see the bride.

307
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,419
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

308
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,783
Not after this!

309
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,694
Okay guys, just relax.

310
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,957
I do!

311
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,897
I got to go.

312
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,341
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

313
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,716
Food's here. Fair enough.

314
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,852
Fifteen-minute warning.

315
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,289
Late.

316
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,673
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
