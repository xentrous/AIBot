1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,080
-Hey.
-Hey. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,440
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,960
Boots? Boots!

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,800
Now, they're a little more than I usually
spend on boots. Or rent.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,080
Did you say you bought "boots"
or "boats"?

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,120
I know.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,560
-I'll miss being able to afford food.
-I'm sorry. They just looked so good.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,360
The saleswoman was like:

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,200
-"These are too expensive for you."
-She had a point.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,840
-Hey.
-Hi. Oh, my God.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,320
-Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
-They're mine!

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,640
-Too bad we're gonna have to return them.
-Return them? They're gonna hear you.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm not returning them. I know they
cost a lot, but I'll wear them all the time.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,880
You'll see. Besides,
I love the compliments.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,800
Have you ever had something
so beautiful, everyone wants it?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,600
-I have you.
-Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,560
That's right. I love you.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,760
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,760
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,760
-He's talking to the baby.
-Oh! Okay.

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Okay, because when he said,
"I can't wait for your first words"..

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
I thought, "There's a trick."

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,960
Well, I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,480
Hey, listen. Can you do me a favor? My
sister knows you work at Ralph Lauren..

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,960
Forget it. No way. I am not sending
more Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,240
-It is a waste.
-No, not her.

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,920
My youngest sister, Dina,
is interested in fashion.

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,280
She wants to talk to someone successful
to give her some advice.

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,200
-I guess I could talk to my supervisors.
-No, she wants to talk to you.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,720
-Okay, so would you meet with her?
-Yes, I'd love to. Have her come by.

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,680
Great, thanks. You'll love her. She's the
smartest of all the Tribbiani children.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,320
-Yeah, you know the SATs?
-Yeah.

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,080
She took them.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,640
-Doesn't Ben go to Smithfield Day School?
-Yeah. Why?

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,000
-Sting has a son that goes there too.
-I know. He's in Ben's class.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,280
You knew and never said anything? With
all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,920
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
"Sting's son, 7 years old."
And there's a picture.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,560
What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools"?

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
It's New York Magazine. It's an article
about the city's best schools.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,080
-So how well do you know Sting?
-I actually haven't even met him.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah. That's too bad. I really wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,040
I know! Why don't you
meet him and get tickets.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,720
If you get two, I'll take you.

47
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,040
There you go. You're so lucky.
You might get to meet Sting tomorrow.

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,640
That's why you have kids.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,520
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,000
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

52
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,120
See, Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out
of them already. They're very practical.

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,120
You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants..

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,800
You wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn the money to pay for them.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
-Wow, they're beautiful.
-They hurt so much.

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,000
-What?
-The guy who made these..

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
hates feet
and wants to see them die.

58
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't. I told Chandler I'd wear them
all the time. I can't just give them away.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,360
-Then get your money back and return them.
-I can't do that either.

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,480
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,360
-Hey.
-Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,920
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,240
I dropped him off at Carol's.

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna
get those tickets, though.

66
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh, no. Why not?

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,480
It turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

68
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,520
-How come?
-Apparently, Sting's son made fun..

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,920
of the fact that Ben's moms
are "lesbenims."

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,440
Wait. If they don't get along, smooth
things over. Make them be friends.

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,600
-You can't force kids to be friends.
-Sure you can.

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,360
Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,960
-Playpen? Ben's 7.
-Your kid is 7?

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
He's really small.

75
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,120
-Please get the tickets.
-I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,960
-Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
-What?

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,440
Look, I'm sorry..

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Phoebe?

79
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
Here she is: future fashion superstar.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,400
-Oh, Joey, I'm hardly..
-My little sister Dina.

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
-Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,960
Thanks so much for meeting with me.
Joey's told me so much about you.

83
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,360
This is so exciting for her.

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,680
-Ralph Lauren smiled at her in the elevator.
-You sure it was at you?

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,120
Because he likes it sometimes
when the buttons light up.

86
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,560
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
get down to business.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,520
You, be good, learn a lot. And if she takes
you to the freebie room, I need shirts..

88
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,440
but none with that creepy logo with
the guy riding the dog, holding the bone.

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,960
Okay. All right, Dina.

90
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,800
Well, let's talk about the different
areas of fashion..

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,040
that you could get involved in.

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,440
Let's see, there's design. But you may
need a whole other degree for that.

93
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,480
-Sales is great. You get to travel.
-I don't care about fashion.

94
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm pregnant. And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,800
Then there's marketing.

96
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,600
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I just was yawning.

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,320
-Don't forget, my office party's tonight.
-That's tonight?

98
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,600
I forgot all about the "secret Santa" gift.

99
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,000
Do we like this?

100
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,640
We don't really have to go to this thing,
do we?

101
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,600
I know that you don't like my office parties,
but you can wear your new boots.

102
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,320
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,000
-I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
-Why not?

104
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm worried your bosses will see them
and think they pay you too much money.

105
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

106
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,040
Do you think I work some kind of
boot-pricing company?

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,680
I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
and the boots don't go with it.

108
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,640
You said those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

109
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,120
What are you planning on wearing,
a chicken suit?

110
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,320
Fine. If you want me to,
I'll wear the boots.

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,720
In fact, I'll go into my room right now
and try the outfit on.

112
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,920
Christmas party in my boots!

113
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,640
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

114
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,960
It's gonna be okay.
He has been incredibly supportive of me.

115
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,280
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

116
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,640
-Thank you.
-Okay.

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,280
Hey! It's my fashion girls.

118
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,840
-What's wrong?
-Why don't you sit down.

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,640
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.

120
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,040
What's going on?
Is it Mom? Is she sick?

121
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,080
Is it Dad's heart?

122
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,600
Is that a sandwich?

123
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
-Mom and Dad are fine.
-Is that a sandwich?!

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,960
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

125
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,440
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

126
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,760
Now. Give him the sandwich!

127
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,280
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

128
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Because you have to have sex
to get pregnant.

129
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,840
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

130
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,840
What? Dina..

131
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,960
I can't believe this. You're the good one.
You went to college! Both years!

132
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Who did this to you?

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,240
Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
I like him a lot. He's real funny.

134
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,640
You got pregnant for "funny"?
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

135
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,480
-I'll be back. Stay here!
-Why? Where you going?

136
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
I can't look at you right now.

137
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,120
I know.

138
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,760
Oh, there you are, Ben.

139
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
You're Ben, right?

140
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

141
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,840
I heard you're having a problem
with one of the boys.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,280
So I thought I'd come and sit you both down,
have a little talk and make it all okay.

143
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,440
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.

144
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,720
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

145
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,800
Sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside..

146
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,520
but they have famous fathers.

147
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
I have to go. My friend Doug
is waiting for me over there.

148
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,640
Wow, your friend Doug
looks a lot like Billy Joel.

149
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,920
-Is that who his father is?
-No. His dad's a dentist.

150
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
Him, you're friends with.

151
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,280
-Excuse me, can I help you with something?
-Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.

152
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,120
-Are you with one of the students?
-I'm with Ben.

153
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,320
-Are you one of Ben's mothers?
-I am one of Ben's mothers.

154
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,760
I'm a lesbian.

155
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,600
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

156
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,640
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm a new teacher here.

157
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,480
-I've only met your partner, Carol.
-That would make me Susan.

158
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,440
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
to discuss his problems with Ben?

159
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,160
I think the parents should sit down together
and have a conversation.

160
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,160
Yeah, let's do that!

161
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,200
That sounds good.

162
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,920
We should sit down and talk.
Me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.

163
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,200
-How will I get in touch with them?
-Their number's on the contact sheet.

164
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,160
Could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

165
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,280
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,240
-You know, that party wasn't bad.
-Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.

167
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,360
That was a fun surprise.

168
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,280
-I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk.
-No, we can't walk.

169
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,200
No. Hey, there's a cab.

170
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,320
That's a police car.

171
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,280
Maybe we could commit a crime,
have them pick us up.

172
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,560
-It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on.
-Okay.

173
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole?

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
-What's going on?
-I can't walk, okay?

175
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,080
-These boots were a huge mistake.
-What?

176
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,160
You were right. I never should have bought
them. They're killing me, one toe at a time.

177
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,280
-So they're really tight, huh?
-I just said you were right, sweetie.

178
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,960
Isn't it clear I'm delirious from the pain?

179
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,080
So I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

180
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,880
It's oddly unsettling.

181
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,560
How are we gonna we get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

182
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,640
I don't think me getting on your back
is gonna improve matters.

183
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,320
Wow, being right sure doesn't help
with the funny.

184
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,040
-Hop on.
-Okay, wait.

185
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
Let me just get my boots off first.

186
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,280
Oh, God.

187
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,080
I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a little turned-on.

188
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will just slip out?

189
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
What college was that, Dina?

190
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,360
Oh, my God. Bobby?

191
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,240
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

192
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,440
-Joey, what are you doing?
-Just what needs to be done.

193
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,160
-Dearly beloved, we're gathered here..
-This is crazy.

194
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,520
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

195
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
-Where were we? Do you take this man..?
-No!

196
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,280
-You'll take him.
-No, I won't!

197
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,280
-You don't get a say.
-Yes, I do.

198
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,640
-I heard "I do." We're halfway there. You.
-All right, Joey, that is enough!

199
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,120
As beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.

200
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,440
They don't have a marriage license or
witnesses, and the groom only has one shoe.

201
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,560
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

202
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
What am I supposed to do?

203
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,000
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and that can make their own decisions.

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,440
No, they can't. They were
stupid enough to get knocked up!

205
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,160
Contraceptives are not
always effective. Right?

206
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,840
-Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
-Come on, kids, a little help here!

207
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,280
Wow! This place is incredible!

208
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,640
Sting's pen..

209
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
that he gave to Phoebe.

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,840
Come on, secret passageway.

211
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

212
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

213
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,920
-Why else would I be here?
-Why don't you sit down.

214
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,480
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting along lately.

215
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm sure there are two sides to this story.

216
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,360
But all I've heard is that
Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."

217
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,720
-I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
-No.

218
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,480
I see. You see, I think it would be better
for the children..

219
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,120
if all the parents were here. Except for,
you know, Ben's birth mother and father.

220
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, I'm sorry.
Jack's father's not available.

221
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,640
Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

222
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,320
No, I know that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.

223
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,160
Concert. Yeah.
That does put us in quite a pickle.

224
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm busy before and after the concert,
and he's obviously busy during.

225
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,040
So I guess you and I should talk
about Jack and Ben right now.

226
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,640
Unless.. Unless..

227
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,640
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert..

228
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,800
all the while thinking
about the children.

229
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,400
-Are you here for tickets?
-Thank you. Four would be great.

230
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

231
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,080
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.

232
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,240
Look, I've just pressed a button
triggering a silent alarm.

233
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,680
-Any minute now, the police will be here.
-The Police? Here?

234
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,960
A reunion?

235
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,800
Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.

236
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,960
-Oh, wait! Stop, stop!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

237
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
My boots in tan! Can you get a little closer
so I see the price?

238
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,400
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

239
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm sorry. I can walk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

240
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,400
-I don't have your boots.
-I don't have them either. Where are they?

241
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,560
Why don't you check in one of my
saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay?

242
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,960
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

243
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,080
Are you ever gonna wear the boots again?

244
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,440
Yes, I am. Okay? They're very practical.

245
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
-I could wear them with pants or skirts..
-Honey. Honey.

246
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Okay, I'll never wear them again. I just
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

247
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,920
You know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

248
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,640
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

249
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,000
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

250
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,560
Just because they're not getting
married doesn't mean it's a disaster.

251
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,480
-Maybe they have a plan.
-Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.

252
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,320
Now, what's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

253
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,760
Well..

254
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,440
I really have high hopes for my band.

255
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,480
-You were right. He is funny.
-Now, wait a minute.

256
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,600
I bet when you told people you wanted
to be an actor, they laughed at you.

257
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,240
Come on, Bobby,
tell us a little bit about your band.

258
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,920
Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

259
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,920
Really?

260
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
If you're having a baby,
you should be married.

261
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,720
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

262
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,440
-I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
-So, what are you gonna do?

263
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Have the baby and raise it by yourself?
Without a husband?

264
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,200
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!

265
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,040
-Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
-No, it's different for you.

266
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,000
You're so strong. You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

267
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,720
-Excuse me?
-One pregnant woman at a time, please!

268
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,360
I just want you to be okay.

269
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,960
So forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

270
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Maybe.

271
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,880
Yeah. So, what kind of music
does Numbnuts..?

272
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, forget it! I can't!

273
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,160
I am scared to death about this. But I
think I can do it. I just need some help.

274
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,040
-Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
-You bet I am.

275
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,000
And to answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

276
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,200
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier
you've made all this on her.

277
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,040
-Why can't you do that for me?
-Because you're my baby sister!

278
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,040
And you're my big brother. You're
my favorite guy in the whole world.

279
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,520
I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.
I was scared of telling you.

280
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,040
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

281
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,720
I can't stand the thought of having
this baby with you mad at me.

282
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,560
I want him to have his uncle.

283
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,120
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

284
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,920
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

285
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,440
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby will be so loved.

286
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,800
-And not just by us.
-That's right.

287
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,520
By his uncle too.

288
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,360
And by you.

289
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Bobby, why don't we come over here and
let them have a little moment, okay?

290
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,160
Come here.

291
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,920
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

292
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
Guess what.

293
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,960
We're good. We're good.
We know each other.

294
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,560
So..

295
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,360
-anyway, guess what.
-Oh, there's more?

296
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,280
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

297
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

298
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Well, let's just say:

299
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,040
-Where are the seats?
-Middle balcony.

300
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,520
Would you say that's
more than 50 yards away..

301
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,280
from Sting, his wife
or a member of his family?

302
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,680
-Yeah.
-Then that's not breaking the law. I'm there!
