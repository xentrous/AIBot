1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:06,099
I think I'll go with the chicken piccata
instead of the Cornish game hen.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,968
Will there be a vegetarian option,
you know, for me?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,674
Yes. Definitely.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:11,775
What is it?

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,302
Dancing.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,176
- Hey.
- Hey.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,750
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,286
Can I get the keys? Thought
I'd take that bad boy for a spin.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,189
Ross drives it? When I ask, you say
you're the only one allowed to drive it.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,660
He's my brother, plus he drives
so slow he could never hurt it.

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,492
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,935
Just replace the bulbs in the
brake lights after you're done.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,171
- Hey.
- Hi.

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,573
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,982
- You let Joey drive it?
- I've never driven it. Not once.

16
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,020
Okay, once.
Okay, I drive it all the time.

17
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,259
So much for the "you-can-drive-it
but-don't-tell-Rachel" plan.

18
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,328
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

19
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:11,300
I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
all you talk about is the wedding.

20
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,270
There. I've blown both your secrets.
Now we're even.

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,540
I won't let you drive the Porsche
because you're a terrible driver.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,082
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,248
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'll take you around the block.

24
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,891
You got a couple hours?

25
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,621
The One With Chandler's Dad

26
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,391
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

27
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,828
- Take the top down, did you?
- Only way to fly.

28
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,533
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.

29
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,646
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.

30
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,215
In high school, that added up
to head cheerleader.

31
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,488
Did you see the look
that girl just gave me?

32
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,327
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

33
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,794
- She's checking out your beehive.
- What?

34
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,699
- Give me a brush.
- The keys.

35
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,425
- No way!
- Well, no brush.

36
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,366
Fine. It doesn't matter.

37
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:57,168
If I remember correctly, there's
a comb on the floor of the bathroom.

38
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,723
Alimony.

39
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,061
We still haven't gotten
an RSVP from your dad.

40
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:25,601
Oh, right. Maybe that's because I
didn't send him an invitation.

41
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,270
Why not?

42
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,068
An invitation?
That's like almost asking him to come.

43
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,106
He's your father.
He should be at our wedding.

44
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,943
I was gonna send him an invite
but then I saw the stamp.

45
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,642
It was one of those Marilyn
Monroe stamps and I thought:

46
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,118
My dad has that dress.

47
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,821
Wow. That must be a very different view
when he stands over an air vent.

48
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,859
You should see him singing
"Happy Birthday, Mr. President."

49
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,963
We have to invite him.

50
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,968
I don't even know the man.
I haven't seen him in years.

51
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,572
And when he finds out
he wasn't asked?

52
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,038
We don't run in the same circles.

53
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,008
I hang out with you guys and he...

54
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,713
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

55
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,145
I think I want to trade circles.

56
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,253
You don't want him there.
Nobody will stare at the bride...

57
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,652
...when the father of the groom
is wearing a backless dress.

58
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,296
So what? As long as he's not wearing
a white dress and veil, I don't care.

59
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,863
I think I need to do some shopping.

60
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,073
Nice.

61
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,337
My God!

62
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,713
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just washing the windshield.

63
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,253
There's no way I'll let you
drive this car.

64
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,188
- Couldn't find the comb?
- No.

65
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,192
Why don't you just hand over the keys.

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,760
Oh!

67
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,898
Do not start this car.

68
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,734
Okay, okay.
I will give you 20 bucks...

69
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,171
...if you get out of this car
right now. Hey!

70
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,305
Look.

71
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,947
If you're so freaked out,
just get in the car.

72
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,741
With you? Yeah, right.

73
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,077
All right.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,947
Okay, okay, okay.

75
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,723
- What are you doing? Get in the front.
- In the death seat?!

76
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,763
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

77
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,235
- Ready to go?
- My purse is at Monica's. I'll be back.

78
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,136
- Wait a minute.
- What? Oh.

79
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,115
That one kept going.

80
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,852
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

81
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,753
- How long have you been going out?
- Over a month.

82
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,325
We ought to get
to know each other better.

83
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,930
- Sure. I'd like that.
- Yeah. So, uh...

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,495
What's your name?

85
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,429
- It's Jake.
- Joey.

86
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,701
- Do you like the Knicks?
- Yeah, big fan.

87
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,208
Me too. There's a game on Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

88
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,938
Great! Let me make sure I'm not
doing anything Tuesday.

89
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,986
Here.

90
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,787
- What's this?
- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

91
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,022
Are you serious? Eloping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

92
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,431
No more these flowers, these flowers.
Think of the money we'll save.

93
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:48,334
We're not eloping. I love the flowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, please?

94
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,136
We're going to see your dad.

95
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,709
I want to get to know
my father-in-law.

96
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,005
We already went over this and I won.

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,979
No, you didn't.
Honey, just so you know...

98
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,552
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

99
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,847
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

100
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,588
I know your dad embarrassed you.

101
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,230
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

102
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,560
You'd have to come up with a new word
for what I went through.

103
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,863
In high school,
he came to all my swim meets...

104
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,733
...dressed as a different
Hollywood starlet.

105
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,168
It's hard enough to be 14.

106
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,039
You're skinny, you're wearing Speedos
that your mom promised you'd grow into.

107
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,849
You look up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

108
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,783
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with real fruit...

109
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:41,221
...that he will later hand out
to your friends as a healthy snack.

110
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,494
But he was there!

111
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,529
My dad didn't come
to one of my Brownie meetings.

112
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,224
You were a Brownie?

113
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,226
No. I ate them.

114
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,503
The point is, he was at every one
of your swim meets, cheering you on.

115
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,539
That's a pretty great dad.

116
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,575
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.

117
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,914
- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
- Does it matter?!

118
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,613
You're not 14 anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.

119
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,823
If he's not at your wedding, you'll
regret it for the rest of your life.

120
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,761
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

121
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,104
- So I never get to win anymore?
- How much did you ever win before?

122
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,613
You know how when you're wearing pants
and you lean forward...

123
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,945
...I check out your underwear?

124
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,283
Well, when Jake did it...

125
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,755
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,621
I know. They were mine.

127
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,761
Oh!

128
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,329
No, no, wait. That's weird.

129
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,199
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

130
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,703
That's weird!

131
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,569
- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
- That's kind of hot.

132
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:10,077
I think so too. And that little flap?
It's great for holding my lipstick.

133
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,116
I wouldn't know about that.

134
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,652
Jake says that women's underwear
is actually more comfortable.

135
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,592
He loves how silk feels
against his skin.

136
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,529
Next he'll say your high heels
are good for his posture.

137
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,633
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.

138
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,272
I think more than you.

139
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,137
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies.

140
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:44,177
I'm just saying only a man completely
secure in his masculinity...

141
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,546
...could wear women's underwear.
I don't think you could.

142
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,553
- I am secure with my masculinity.
- Okay, whatever.

143
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,248
You've seen my huge
stack of porn, right?

144
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,088
Here you go.

145
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,928
Look all you want.
There's nothing there.

146
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,147
Slow down,
or I am returning to the back seat.

147
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,675
Would you calm down?

148
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,784
No! You're driving 15 miles
over the speed limit.

149
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,389
I'm driving 5 miles over the limit.
They raised it by 10.

150
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,983
What, are they crazy?!

151
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,730
God, I forgot how much I love driving.

152
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,530
I have got to get my license renewed.

153
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,375
You don't have a valid driver's
license? Pull over right now.

154
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,241
Ross, you're so tense.
You just gotta relax, okay?

155
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:53,407
Just need to relax. All right?
Just need to relax.

156
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,244
What are you...? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

157
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,754
I am not horsing around, okay?

158
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,928
I am "Porsche-ing" around.

159
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,859
Uh-oh.

160
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:14,636
Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.

161
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,132
Really? You think so?

162
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,006
I was talking to myself.
You're going down!

163
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,678
Has someone taken your order?

164
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,221
Oh, yeah. She did. He did. She?

165
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,154
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...

166
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,422
- I just ordered a beer.
- You're straight. I get it.

167
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,395
If we called your dad,
we'd have better seats.

168
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,199
I don't want him to know we're
here yet. I'm not ready for that.

169
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,036
Besides, he won't be too happy
to see me either.

170
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,576
Why not?

171
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,744
I don't know if I told you...

172
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,974
...but he's kind of tried to contact me
a lot the last few years.

173
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,117
What?

174
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,288
Yeah. He's made phone calls,
written letters.

175
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,948
He came to New York.
But I always said I was too busy.

176
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,129
It's very "Cats in the Cradle."
I don't want to get into it.

177
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,361
Here we go.

178
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,968
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome the incomparable...

179
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,163
...Helena Handbasket.

180
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,836
Hello, darlings.

181
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,910
And there's Daddy.

182
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,314
Switch places with me. Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.

183
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,322
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
- Come on!

184
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,358
- What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.
- Come on!

185
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,554
I'm sure we won't get arrested
for this.

186
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,826
God!

187
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,708
Hi, officer.
Was I going a little too fast?

188
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,432
Oh, my God.

189
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,303
- Can I see your license, please?
- Absolutely.

190
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:40,713
It's weird. I had a dream last night
that I was stopped by a policeman.

191
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,080
And then he...

192
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,519
Well, I probably shouldn't
tell you the rest.

193
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,782
He gave you a big...

194
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,925
...fat...

195
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,287
...ticket?

196
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,364
- Your license.
- Yes. Here you go, Officer...

197
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,798
...Handsome.

198
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,871
- It's Hanson.
- Oops, sorry. My mistake.

199
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,632
Dear Lord!

200
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,976
- Wow!
- Here it comes.

201
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,972
This is a great picture.

202
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,253
Really? You think so? You know,
I had just rolled right out of bed.

203
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,443
You look phenomenal.

204
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,419
She should!
It was taken 10 years ago!

205
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,992
You know, you're probably wondering
about the old date.

206
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,997
Yes, I am. You're an Aquarius, huh?

207
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,932
- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
- No.

208
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,265
- Taurus?
- No.

209
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,238
- Virgo?
- No.

210
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,334
- Sagittarius?
- Yep.

211
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,843
I knew it. I knew it!

212
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,948
- You won't speed anymore, right?
- I won't speed.

213
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,675
- And you promise to take care of this?
- I promise.

214
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,378
In the meantime, let him drive.
Does he have a license?

215
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,989
- Can he handle a stick?
- Well...

216
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,557
I can handle a stick!

217
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:14,271
- That can't be your father.
- I've been saying that for years.

218
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,471
- Oh, my God!
- What?

219
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,047
That's Mr. Garibaldi
playing the piano.

220
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,226
Hello, and welcome to the show.

221
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,064
I see some of our regulars
in the audience.

222
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,431
And a couple of irregulars.

223
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:48,409
- He's coming into the audience.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

224
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,480
Oh, much better.
You're invisible now.

225
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,744
- Where are you from?
- Bakersfield.

226
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,920
- I'm sorry?
- Bakersfield.

227
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,049
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

228
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,660
It can't happen like this.
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

229
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,262
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.

230
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,097
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.

231
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,774
Can we have our drinks, please?
Waiter?...tress?

232
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,195
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

233
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,897
Check it out.

234
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,063
How much of a man am I?

235
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:53,711
Wow, nice.
Manly, and also kind of a slut.

236
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,246
I'm beginning to see what Jake
was talking about.

237
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,418
The silk feels really good.

238
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,780
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they would be.

239
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,116
That's great.

240
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,056
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

241
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:15,256
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: Cotton, silk, lace.

242
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,937
You know what I've always
wondered about? Pantyhose!

243
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,164
The way they start at your toe,
then they go all the way up to...

244
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:30,475
- I should go take these off, shouldn't I?
- I think it's important you do.

245
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,576
What's your name?

246
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,586
Chandler.

247
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:39,924
Chandler?

248
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,255
What an unusual name.

249
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,654
You must have had terribly
fascinating parents.

250
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,726
Oh, they're a hoot.

251
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,495
And who is your friend?

252
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,131
I'm Monica.

253
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,031
- Monica. Where are you from?
- New York.

254
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,175
I'm not very fond of New York.

255
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,405
Queens, I like.

256
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,117
What is this...

257
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:11,152
...sparkling something, honey, huh?

258
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,188
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.

259
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,793
Really?

260
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,455
Congratulations.

261
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,963
When's the big day?

262
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,364
In two weeks.

263
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,870
I see.

264
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,675
Well, I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

265
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,305
So, you're bald.

266
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,713
Wait, wait.

267
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,385
We'd love it if you could be there.

268
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,989
Really?

269
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,854
I know it would make me happy...

270
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,493
...ma'am.

271
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,501
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.

272
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,602
I'm getting all misty here.

273
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,506
You'd think I was having my legs waxed
or something.

274
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,349
- You okay?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,150
Thanks for making me do this.

276
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,848
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...

277
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,789
...how lucky they are
to have found each other.

278
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,323
In every life a little rain must fall.

279
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,000
Fortunately...

280
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,964
...in my life...

281
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,416
When I was growing up,
I played the one on the far left.

282
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,428
I think you've had enough fun
for today.

283
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,423
Remind me to introduce you
to someone.

284
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,964
- Who?
- Fourth gear.

285
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,936
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

286
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:14,568
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
from the 10 and 2:00 position.

287
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:21,078
Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to flirt some more.

288
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,751
Perhaps he didn't tarnish
the badge enough.

289
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,026
It's a different guy.

290
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,264
- Good evening, officer.
- Do you know how fast you were going?

291
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,028
No, I don't, but it couldn't
have been more than 60.

292
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,933
You're right. It was 37.

293
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,073
Really?

294
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,611
- Can I see your license, please?
- You're kidding.

295
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,114
You're not gonna give me a ticket
for driving too slow, are you?

296
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,953
That's right.

297
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,684
You wanna help me out here?

298
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,251
I'm sorry, what?

299
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,732
Can you do your little thing
that you did before?

300
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,829
I don't think so.

301
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,563
I don't think I want
to tarnish his badge.

302
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,616
You know, officer...

303
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,218
I had the weirdest dream last night.

304
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,081
Oh, my God!

305
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,251
Your license, please.

306
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,256
You don't want to hear
about my dream...

307
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,929
...Officer...

308
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,496
...Pretty?

309
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,235
It's Petty.

310
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,133
I'll be right back with your ticket.

311
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,539
- You have a son.
- I know. I know.

312
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,382
- You feel better?
- Yeah. Much.

313
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,248
Listen...

314
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,353
Not that I'm insecure
about my manhood or anything...

315
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,519
...but I think I need to hook up
with a woman right now.

316
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,225
I understand.

317
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,739
You look familiar. Do I know you?

318
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,202
I don't think so.

319
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,743
Maybe it's because I'm on television.

320
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,511
- I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.
- Wow. Really?

321
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,415
- $4.50, please.
- Oh, let me get this.

322
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,061
These are for you.
