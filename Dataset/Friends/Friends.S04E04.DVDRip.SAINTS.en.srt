1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,065
Hey, new wallet?

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,366
It was time.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,806
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,674
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,645
I know,
but the garbage was full.

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,887
Have you ever taken out the trash?

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,988
Since you've lived here?

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,618
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,229
-Third door on the left.
-Right!

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,937
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,226
What are you doing?

12
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,495
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,504
It's a little old but...

14
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,338
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

15
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,482
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,516
Of course not.
You're a little princess.

17
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,487
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

18
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,420
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

19
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:37,528
Daddy, make the cast of Cats
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

20
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,496
You think you can come here...

21
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,601
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

22
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,864
Think of someone else for a change.

23
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,706
Okay, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,280
God, if you're going to cry about it!

25
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,025
The One With Ballroom Dancing

26
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,898
Treeger made you cry?

27
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,908
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

28
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,945
I'll teach him a lesson.

29
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,640
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

30
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,787
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

31
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,288
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

32
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,058
Is this a gym card?

33
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,494
Oh, yeah, gym member.

34
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,267
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

35
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,937
...the last 1200 times.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,467
So why don't you quit?

37
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,243
You don't think I've tried?

38
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,515
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

39
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,911
They make you go
all the way down there.

40
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,587
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

41
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,952
And then they bring out Maria.

42
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,624
-Who is Maria?
-Oh, Maria!

43
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,791
You can't say no to her.

44
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,802
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

45
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,775
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

46
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,775
You're strong enough to face her?

47
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,972
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

48
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,687
Tribbiani.
Hold on.

49
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,049
I'll get the plunger.

50
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,193
You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

51
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,558
So you'll go and apologize to her...

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,734
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

53
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,163
And tell him what?

54
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,896
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."

55
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:38,633
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

56
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,639
I have actually not heard of that.

57
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,015
Your friends are violating it.

58
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,755
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

59
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,547
I'm telling the landlord...

60
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,023
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

61
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,560
Your friends are out of here, pal.

62
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,933
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

63
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,334
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

64
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,768
What's the matter?

65
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,171
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

66
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,108
Every time I see him,
I want to...

67
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,713
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

68
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,847
So do them for free.

69
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,083
No, it is forbidden.

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,797
Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

71
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,533
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

72
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,431
-They make you take an oath?
-No, I made myself take one.

73
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,868
No fooling around with clients...

74
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,440
...and always be prepared.

75
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,281
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

76
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,019
Why not give him to someone else?

77
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,950
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

78
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,651
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,559
You got a pedicure.

80
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,285
Your feet are all dressed up.

81
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,830
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

82
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,164
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

83
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,676
I don't know what
you're talking about.

84
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,109
How do you explain the toe ring?

85
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,485
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

86
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,751
My hero! What happened?

87
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,922
I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

88
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,156
And he better apologize.
See you!

89
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,924
Wait a minute.

90
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,592
What did he say?

91
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,668
He wouldn't apologize because
you're living here illegally.

92
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,674
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

93
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,144
-You got us evicted?
-I told you not to go down there.

94
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,610
He made Rachel cry!

95
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,545
Rachel always cries!

96
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,845
That's not true!

97
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,524
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

98
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,557
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

99
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,889
All right, I'll try.

100
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,159
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

101
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,531
-Go!
-All right, all right.

102
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,400
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

103
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,745
Remember what we talked about.
You got to be strong.

104
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,383
Now one more time.

105
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,113
Don't you want a washboard stomach
and rock-hard pecs?

106
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,921
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

107
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,294
That's good.

108
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,305
I want to quit the gym.

109
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,407
You want to quit?

110
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,839
I want to quit the gym.

111
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:05,679
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

112
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,750
I want to quit the gym.

113
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,918
Dave in the membership office
handles quitters.

114
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,631
Excuse me.
Are you a member?

115
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,361
Me?

116
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,772
Sorry. Members only.

117
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,506
I want to quit the gym!

118
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,272
It's okay, man.
Be strong.

119
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,115
Are you a member of any gym?

120
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,054
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

121
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,785
Okay, no problem.

122
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,393
Could you come here?

123
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,900
Hi, I'm Maria.

124
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,118
You have really pretty feet.

125
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,277
These old things?

126
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,792
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

127
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,057
You mean...

128
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,789
By sciatic, you mean...

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,332
...the towel-covered portion?

130
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,836
Sure, I can do that.

131
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,668
Because the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

132
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,310
...real nice and tight.

133
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:49,016
So tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

134
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,122
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

135
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,864
-Did you just bite me?
-No!

136
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,984
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

137
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,881
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

138
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,520
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

139
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,016
You have pets?

140
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,120
Those are nicknames.

141
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,865
I'm the "chick,"
and Chandler's the "duck."

142
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,367
I would've thought
it was the other way around.

143
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,733
Come on.
Let the girls stay.

144
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,669
I'll do whatever you want.

145
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,739
Really? You'd do anything?

146
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,239
Yeah, absolutely.

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,411
I got something.

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,708
What is it?

149
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,549
Can you be my dancing partner?

150
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,382
That's not prison lingo, is it?

151
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,059
I want to quit the gym.

152
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,663
Can you honestly tell me that you're
100% satisfied with your body.

153
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,793
Yes, yes. Most of the time.

154
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:16,533
I mean, sure, I have my bad days, but
then I remember what a cute smile I have.

155
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,376
We were voted "Best-equipped Gym
in New York" two years running.

156
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,539
-Do you really want to give that up?
-Yes, I hate it here.

157
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,210
Everything that you have
in here is very heavy.

158
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,482
Really? Okay?

159
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,195
You want to make your
friend work out alone?

160
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,567
-What friend?
-Your friend Ross. Just joined.

161
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,737
His dancing partner?

162
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,383
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball."

163
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,519
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

164
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,748
Why not practice with a girl?

165
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,017
He's too shy.

166
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,219
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

167
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,419
Yeah, right.

168
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,967
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

169
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,936
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

170
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,204
So did you quit?

171
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,044
I almost did.

172
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,649
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

173
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,113
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

174
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,087
And that's funny, why?

175
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,762
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and...

176
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,090
Well, that's it.

177
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,038
We're doomed.

178
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,800
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

179
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,068
What are we gonna do?

180
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,975
You could actually go to the gym.

181
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,782
Or we could go to the bank...

182
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,890
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

183
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,955
You're a genius.

184
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,463
Oh, man! But then,
we won't be bank buddies.

185
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,833
Now there's two reasons.

186
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,472
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

187
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,805
I bit him.

188
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,845
-Where?
-On the tushy.

189
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,213
And that's not against your oath?

190
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,884
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

191
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,323
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

192
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,226
Next time, try to distract yourself.

193
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,934
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

194
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,070
...and I don't want to get too...

195
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,772
...excited.

196
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,807
I try and think of other things.
Like sandwiches...

197
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,842
...and baseball...

198
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,405
...and Chandler.

199
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,613
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.

200
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,887
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

201
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,258
Okay, well...

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,131
...just follow my lead.

203
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,362
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

204
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,767
Like get really drunk?

205
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,640
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

206
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,819
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,083
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

208
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,284
...my breasts are coming out my back.

209
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,263
Forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

210
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:01,855
My mom was right.

211
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,332
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

212
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,064
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

213
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,674
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

214
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,441
Marge will never go for me.

215
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,108
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

216
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,144
You just need more practice.

217
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,515
Come on.
Let's try it again.

218
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,558
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

219
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,358
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a

220
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,898
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

221
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,976
You guys owe me bigtime.

222
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,386
What was that?

223
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,784
You just did a little dancy thing.

224
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,291
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

225
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,326
-You did a little hop.
-You are so enjoying this.

226
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,897
No, I'm not.

227
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,159
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourree.

228
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,403
You know the words!

229
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,303
You are so into this!

230
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,913
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

231
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:28,182
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

232
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,489
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

233
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,726
It's like a sport, it's manly.

234
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,896
-Show me some "manly" moves.
-All right.

235
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,391
I don't know how to lead.

236
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,534
Hello.

237
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,405
We'd like to close our accounts.

238
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,148
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

239
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,916
No, we'd just like to close them.

240
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,053
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

241
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,315
Would you come over here, please?

242
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,253
Hi, I'm Karen.

243
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,231
I want to quit the bank!

244
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,565
Okay. Baseball.

245
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,433
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.

246
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,108
Maybe even his pants
come down a little.

247
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,607
Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches.

248
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,714
Okay, on a plate.

249
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,785
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.

250
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,588
Chandler.

251
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,890
Okay, Chandler.
That's working!

252
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,101
Chandler's knees.

253
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,407
Chandler's ankles.

254
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,598
Chandler's ankle hair.

255
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,275
Oh, no!

256
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,712
Okay, you're all set.

257
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,707
Wow! That was amazing!

258
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,817
Was that really just an hour?

259
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,584
In really long-hour world.

260
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,586
What?

261
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,826
I have an enormous crush on you.

262
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,891
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

263
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,930
...even though you give me
the feelings.

264
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,329
I had no idea.

265
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,500
I can always find another masseuse.

266
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,999
Really?

267
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,246
Yeah, really.

268
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,575
What?

269
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,152
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

270
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,683
Quiet down.

271
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,830
Mr. Simon's been waiting
Oh, my God!

272
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,532
Why wasn't I offered that?

273
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,635
I'd definitely pay more for that.

274
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,868
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

275
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,907
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

276
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,637
...because Rick is my husband.

277
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,409
Oh, really?

278
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,778
You'd better tell his other wife.

279
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,546
She called three times
asking where he is.

280
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,884
Yes, I will tell her.

281
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,630
So you didn't leave the bank?

282
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:31,267
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

283
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,697
What will you ever use that for?

284
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,501
To pay for the gym.

285
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,837
So I had a great day.

286
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,414
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

287
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,915
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

288
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,183
-You got fired?
-Oh, my gosh!

289
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,292
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

290
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,120
Sweetie.

291
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,356
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

292
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:07,231
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

293
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,631
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

294
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,605
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

295
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,477
Hey, Duck.
Is Chick here?

296
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,090
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

297
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,457
Ready for our last practice?

298
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:34,858
We're not getting that spin right
because my place is too small.

299
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,503
-Want to use our place?
-No, I had another idea.

300
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,007
We did it!

301
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,343
That was incredible!

302
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,108
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

303
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,221
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.

304
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,654
Oh, my God!
Look at the time.

305
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,951
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

306
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,487
Good luck.

307
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,793
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

308
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,369
Thanks, but no.

309
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,601
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

310
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,009
-Go get them, Treeger.
-Right.

311
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,988
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

312
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,215
Really?

313
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,086
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

314
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:10,994
No, I'm good.

315
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,075
It looks like you've got
great experience.

316
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,812
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

317
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,645
They thought I was a whore.

318
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,057
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

319
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,253
Great. Thank you very much.
