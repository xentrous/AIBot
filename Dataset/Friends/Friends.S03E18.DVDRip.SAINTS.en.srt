1
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,106
What's so funny?

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:14,040
Nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,045
What? What's so funny?

4
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,886
No, no. There's none of that in here.

5
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,790
Come on, man. At least let me
finish this last one.

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,862
Only if you give me a drag.

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,900
Okay.

8
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,077
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

9
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,012
No, why don't you hold on to that one.

10
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,828
Okay, that's like
the least fun game ever.

11
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,896
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something...

12
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,158
...that is going to help you quit.

13
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,106
Nope. That patch is no good.

14
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,872
It's a hypnosis tape.

15
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,778
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

16
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:30,856
What's your problem?

17
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,417
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

18
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,391
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

19
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,066
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

20
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,295
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

21
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,199
I was trying to distract attention...

22
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,313
...from that poor, old woman who was
trying to stuff her breasts into tube socks.

23
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,846
Forget hypnosis.

24
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,645
The way to quit smoking is to
dance naked in a field of heather...

25
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,551
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy, young men.

26
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,686
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night."

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,866
The One With the Hypnosis Tape

28
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,805
- Here you go.
- I didn't want cinnamon on this.

29
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,138
Sorry.

30
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,015
- Hi.
- Oh, my God! Frank!

31
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,719
How are you?

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,656
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,627
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

34
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,064
And then my mom locked me out
of the house, so I couldn't find it.

35
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,874
Then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

36
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,069
What happened?

37
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,705
Vandalism.

38
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,681
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

39
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,349
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

40
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,955
- You're getting married?
- Oh, yeah!

41
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,523
My little brother's getting married!

42
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,964
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Do you wanna meet her?

43
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,396
Do I?

44
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,065
Do you?

45
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,096
Yeah, I do.

46
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,334
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

47
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:11,483
- I gonna go get my fiancee, man!
- All right.

48
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,878
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,682
Isn't it fantastic?

50
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,051
Don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

51
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,317
Well, he's 18.

52
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,021
It'll be illegal for him to drink
at his own bachelor party.

53
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,100
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

54
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,133
Always illegal, Joe.

55
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,232
Hey, this is my fiancee...

56
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,412
...Mrs. Knight.

57
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,142
- That's my sister.
- You know, it's funny.

58
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:49,549
Frank told me so much about you, but
you're not how I pictured you at all.

59
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,589
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

60
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,419
- Here, you go.
- Thank you.

61
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,787
Here, grab a seat.

62
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,587
So how did you guys meet?

63
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,596
Well, I was in Mrs. Knight's...

64
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,737
I mean, Alice. Sorry, Alice.
I always do that.

65
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,401
- I was in her home-ec class.
- He was my best student.

66
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,772
Yeah. She was my best teacher.

67
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,256
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

68
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,456
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

69
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:36,829
Yeah. We talked about
just living together...

70
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,071
...but we want kids right away.

71
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,737
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,434
Great!

73
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,108
Kids. Frank, are you sure
you're ready for that?

74
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,108
How hard can it be?

75
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,753
You know, I mean, it's babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

76
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,289
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

77
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,894
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

78
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,259
- Yeah.
- Right?

79
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,936
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

80
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,767
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

81
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:20,378
Oh, no, but when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

82
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,181
You are falling fast asleep.

83
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,183
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

84
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,091
You are now completely asleep.

85
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,522
You don't need to smoke.

86
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,390
Cigarettes don't control you.

87
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,793
You are a strong, confident woman...

88
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,537
...who does not need to smoke.

89
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,741
A strong, confident woman.

90
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,011
You know what?

91
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,239
I realized in the last year I've
only gone out with Richard and Julio.

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,015
You gotta help me out, set me up.
Get me back in the game.

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,243
Not a problem.

94
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,651
I work in fashion, and all I meet
are eligible straight men.

95
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,619
Can I get you something else?

96
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,527
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

97
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,931
- Haven't we covered that topic?
- You just said to her...

98
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,865
You wanna go out with me...

99
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,337
...because of my wig, boobs,
and because I serve you food.

100
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,340
Well, if that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

101
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,609
And the two times we went out,
it was just plain awkward.

102
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,518
Come on. You think she should
go out with me, don't you?

103
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,625
Well, I mean, are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

104
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,852
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning.

105
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,727
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

106
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,796
- I mean, think about it.
- Oh, I will.

107
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:00,669
No, I know. I know that
this is Frank's life. You know.

108
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,281
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

109
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,686
What, is it the age thing?

110
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,514
I'm fine with the age thing...

111
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:13,522
...until it sticks its tongue
down my little brother's throat.

112
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,463
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

113
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,326
You think he'll enjoy it when he's
up to his elbows in diapers...

114
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,900
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

115
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,230
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

116
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,036
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

117
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,708
Well, have you told him how you feel?

118
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,783
Yes. Not out loud.

119
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,649
- Pheebs, he's not a mind reader.
- We don't know that.

120
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,524
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

121
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,426
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

122
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:58,002
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

123
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,373
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

124
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,633
No, no, no, no.

125
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,903
Come on, you guys.

126
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,076
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

127
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:14,012
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

128
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,284
- No.
- No.

129
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,092
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

130
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,061
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

131
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,528
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?

132
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,193
And then you say, "Let's just
hang out at your place."

133
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,703
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

134
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,110
I think you should
go out with this guy.

135
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,109
He doesn't do anything for me.

136
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:46,478
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

137
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,589
Well, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids.

138
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,487
- All right, I get your point.
- All right.

139
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,025
- Hi.
- Hey.

140
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,254
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

141
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,025
I just carry it around.

142
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,734
- You got any Chap Stick?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,238
- How are those tapes working out?
- Good. I haven't smoked yet today.

144
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,877
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

145
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,946
Thank you.

146
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,551
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

147
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:26,657
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

148
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,791
That check thing was adorable.

149
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,622
What check thing?

150
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,995
As a joke, this customer who has
a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip.

151
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,898
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

152
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,730
Pete Becker. Pete...

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,770
Is this him?

154
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,212
That's Bill Clinton.

155
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,445
Who's he hugging?

156
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,420
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

157
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,387
This guy invented Moss 865.

158
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,096
Every office in the world
uses that program.

159
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,822
- We use it!
- There you go!

160
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,430
Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

161
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,269
- I'm not gonna go out with him.
- Why not? He's a millionaire.

162
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:22,640
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is a
real $20,000 check. This is so exciting.

163
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,306
- Or incredibly offensive.
- Yeah, sure. That too.

164
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,855
What?

165
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,233
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

166
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,534
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay? She's 44.

167
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,001
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

168
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,145
What? You don't think I know that?

169
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,475
All right, I'm gonna
go play basketball.

170
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,053
Or let the really good guys
use my ball...

171
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,190
...while I say, "Can I play?"

172
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,590
Joe, you left your keys in the door.

173
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,164
Here you go.

174
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,836
The point is...

175
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,105
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

176
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,316
He's right. He's right.
This is your time.

177
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,487
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

178
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,989
Isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

179
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,463
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

180
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,190
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

181
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,134
- You don't have it anymore?
- No. I slept with someone else.

182
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,398
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

183
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,102
It didn't.

184
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,478
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

185
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,915
- Now, what is that like?
- It's so cool, man.

186
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,487
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

187
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,219
- Why can't I find that?
- I had it and I blew it.

188
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,058
- Well, I want it!
- You can have it.

189
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,733
Maybe there's something
wrong with me.

190
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,934
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

191
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,476
- Then, you hold on to it!
- All right, man!

192
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,475
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

193
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,774
You're Frank's best man?

194
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,946
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

195
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,089
What about you, huh?

196
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,055
I'm the ring bearer.

197
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,512
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real home-ec emergency.

198
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,843
- Oh, my God. Who died on this?
- Yeah, I know.

199
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,816
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."

200
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,222
Can you help?

201
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,754
Absolutely. First, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

202
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,192
- Then if that doesn't work...
- Forget it. It's ruined.

203
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,958
Never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

204
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,660
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

205
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:37,531
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother Frank?

206
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,680
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

207
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,012
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

208
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,282
You have a Monica Geller here.

209
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,356
Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

210
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,758
Hi.

211
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,554
What the hell is this?

212
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,968
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

213
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,726
You got it.

214
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,196
- I'm sorry. What?
- What is this supposed to mean?

215
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,638
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

216
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,746
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

217
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,718
Are you buying me? Is this the way
you get girls to go out with you?

218
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,823
I'm still here.

219
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,491
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip...

220
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,030
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

221
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,328
...and there wouldn't be
this heat between us.

222
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:43,264
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

223
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,943
You were the chef
and I was the customer.

224
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,546
But now we're, like,
this couple that fights.

225
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,907
You're a loon.

226
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,054
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

227
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,917
I think you're great.

228
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,749
Come on, what do you say?

229
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,695
I don't know.

230
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,627
Why not?

231
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,692
Because I don't wanna encourage
this kind of behavior.

232
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:16,136
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

233
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,900
We go out, we eat.

234
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,103
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

235
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,284
- Hi.
- No!

236
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,587
Wait, no. Just put
the mail down. It's me.

237
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,230
Sorry. Why were you
just, like, all in the dark?

238
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:47,497
Well, your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

239
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,765
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, sure.

240
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,670
So how was your day?

241
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:56,143
Well, just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

242
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,814
What happened?

243
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,512
Alice... She called it off.

244
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,623
Oh, no.

245
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,619
Did she say why?

246
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,855
No. Just that I was too young.

247
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,830
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young...

248
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,597
...because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

249
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,539
Yeah, yeah. No. I don't...

250
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:29,578
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

251
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,309
Well, yeah, if the best is,
like, unbelievable pain.

252
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,117
Oh, sweetie.

253
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,085
You know, I was just finally happy.

254
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,325
For the first time in my life...

255
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,587
...after my dad left me...

256
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:50,099
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

257
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,931
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

258
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,665
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

259
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:03,780
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

260
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:09,453
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

261
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,959
Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

262
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,921
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

263
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,465
What?

264
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,728
I kind of had a little chat
with Alice...

265
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,101
...and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

266
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,641
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

267
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,313
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

268
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,907
Okay...

269
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,710
My mother didn't want us
to be together...

270
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,048
...but the worst thing she ever did
was tie me to the porch.

271
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:51,354
You know, I came to you because
I thought you'd understand. Oh, no!

272
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,355
You know...

273
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,058
...I would storm out of here...

274
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,796
...if I had some money
or a place to go.

275
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,542
Ross, if you had a million dollars,
what's the first thing you'd buy?

276
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,078
I'd get some municipal bonds,
put the rest in the bank...

277
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,718
...and live off the interest.

278
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,451
Well...

279
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,714
...we've heard from Dr. Fun.

280
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,196
- Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!
- Oh, my God!

281
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,693
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

282
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:36,671
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

283
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,277
I know.

284
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,107
Okay, then get the lobster.

285
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,986
- Hey.
- Hi.

286
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,781
- Hi.
- Hey.

287
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,148
How much cash you got
in your pocket now?

288
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,424
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

289
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,033
Why not? Hey, come in for a drink.

290
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,994
- Where do you wanna go?
- You like pizza?

291
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,198
- That sounds great.
- I know a great little place.

292
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,339
You're not paying for the pizza.

293
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,486
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

294
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,619
Is that enough lira?

295
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,848
I'd throw another 1000 on that.

296
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,425
- How much is that?
- That's about 60 cents.

297
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,636
Every night!

298
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,971
You don't need to smoke.

299
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,840
Cigarettes don't control you.

300
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,814
You are a strong, confident woman...

301
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,579
...who does not need to smoke.

302
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,985
A strong, confident woman...

303
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,717
...who does not need to smoke.

304
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,737
So can I.

305
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,611
Hey, Frank.

306
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,345
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

307
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,016
But I so didn't.

308
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:31,554
There's someone here who can
explain this better than I can.

309
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,253
Hi, Frank.

310
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,957
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

311
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,067
Phoebe's right, Frank.

312
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,937
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

313
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,840
I was being selfish.

314
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,312
Even though we want
the same things right now...

315
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,851
...in the future, we may not.

316
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,717
- Is that what it is?
- Yes, but not just that.

317
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,084
Not just that.

318
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:16,598
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

319
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,269
...nonetheless...

320
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,402
- Nonetheless.
- Nonetheless.

321
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,104
You're too young...

322
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,614
...to really know what you want.

323
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,515
That's right, exactly.

324
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,455
All right, that's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

325
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,687
Bye-bye.

326
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:49,898
But no, the important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

327
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,764
This is clearly wrong.

328
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,363
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

329
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,134
Okay, can I just get my purse?
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,109
Okay, all right, good.

331
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,751
Cigarettes don't control you.

332
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,980
You are a strong, confident woman...

333
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,717
...who does not need to smoke.

334
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,395
Joey's your best friend.

335
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,969
You wanna make him
