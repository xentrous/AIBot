1
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,704
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,568
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,966
Fifteen?

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,146
Your personal best!

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,417
Where were you?

6
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,642
On a date.

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,346
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,490
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?

9
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,794
No. Answer his.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,892
We were at the back of the train.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,466
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

12
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,638
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

13
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,172
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

14
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,943
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

15
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,548
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,184
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie?

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,720
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

18
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,692
Done! I did it.

19
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,359
Who's stupid now?

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,892
The One with the
Girl From Poughkeepsie

21
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,112
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

22
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,316
That paper is two weeks old.

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,951
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

24
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,220
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

25
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,556
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

26
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,995
I hate being alone
this time of year.

27
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,332
Next it's Valentine's Day...

28
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,503
...then my birthday, then bang!

29
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,070
Before you know it, they're
lighting that damn tree again.

30
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,243
I want somebody!

31
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,976
You know, I want a man!

32
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:40,122
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

33
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,454
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

34
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,656
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

35
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,366
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

36
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,805
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

37
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,477
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

38
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,344
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

39
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,222
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

40
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,026
Okay.

41
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,353
No accountants.

42
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,895
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.

43
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,657
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

44
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,206
What's wrong, Mon?

45
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,271
Everybody at work still hates me.

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,846
Is it because of the review
you wrote or something new?

47
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,639
It's the review.

48
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,343
I was making headway.

49
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,782
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

50
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,184
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

51
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,955
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

52
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,230
What's the matter?

53
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,573
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

54
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,979
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,947
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

56
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,955
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

57
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,356
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,393
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

59
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:33,204
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

60
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,667
You know what you can do?

61
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,138
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

62
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,380
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

63
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,310
Then they would all know who was boss.

64
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,821
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

65
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,449
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

66
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,491
Good enough to get fired.

67
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,259
All right. You're hired!

68
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:06,762
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

69
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,445
Yes.

70
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,114
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

71
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,354
I'm not asking for me.

72
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,294
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

73
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,159
I'm not gay.

74
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,601
I didn't think you were gay.

75
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,327
I do now.

76
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,703
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

77
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,544
I just got out of
a big relationship.

78
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,679
I'm not looking to get serious.

79
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,281
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

80
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,888
Is this "Hot Rachel" that
you took to the Christmas Party?

81
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,622
By the way, that is her full name.

82
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,954
Wow! I'm free for her.

83
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,629
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

84
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,656
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

85
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,065
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

86
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,738
I'll bring them
by your office at five.

87
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,871
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

88
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:23,014
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

89
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,677
I don't know what that is,
but that's a pretty nice jacket.

90
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,422
Kind of like that tie too.

91
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,397
Keep your pants on, man.

92
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,943
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

93
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,480
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

94
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,649
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

95
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,759
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

96
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,292
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

97
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,525
Pheebs, that's great!

98
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,671
But you know,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

99
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,711
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

100
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,213
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

101
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:33,782
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

102
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,453
Maypole.

103
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,552
All good. Thanks.

104
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,988
Do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

105
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,528
Didn't your dad used to call you
"Pumpkin"?

106
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,293
Pumpkin? But did he ever
call you "Budolph"?

107
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,467
Hello, children.

108
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,143
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

109
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,980
-Really?
-I showed them your picture.

110
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,185
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

111
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,182
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?

112
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,321
Wherever! I've got 20.

113
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,417
Will I like any of these guys?

114
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,594
You know, I'm going to...

115
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,229
...play the field a little bit more.

116
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,598
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

117
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,936
You work with robots?

118
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,872
Yes.

119
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:38,247
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

120
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,213
I like swimmers' bodies.

121
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,217
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

122
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,990
I like credit cards!

123
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,284
I'm not bad at this!

124
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,053
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.

125
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:55,731
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company...

126
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,062
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

127
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,900
No, the robots just work for them.

128
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,168
All right, I'm going to work.

129
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,714
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

130
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,075
Yeah, lady. I do!

131
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,376
I got a problem!

132
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,712
I'll give you a problem!

133
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,984
What will you do?
Fire me?

134
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,658
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

135
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,293
-See you later.
-Thanks.

136
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,733
I should go.
I've got a date.

137
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,163
With who?

138
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,340
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

139
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,907
Not her.

140
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,407
This is someone else.

141
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,080
I can't decide between the two.

142
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,749
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

143
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,454
...really smart and a lot of fun.

144
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,614
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

145
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,093
She's just as pretty.

146
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,095
I guess she's smart.

147
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,492
She's not fun.

148
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,238
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

149
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,237
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

150
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,109
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

151
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,415
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

152
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,654
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

153
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,854
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

154
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,929
Damn!

155
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,534
What happened to your fancy jacket?

156
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,437
They baked it.

157
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,971
I can't take this anymore.

158
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,876
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it.

159
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,517
What are you doing?

160
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,813
You're still on fire there.

161
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,388
I think you got it!

162
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,365
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

163
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,661
Like father, like son.

164
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,571
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

165
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,104
This could, maybe, get serious.

166
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,342
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

167
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,208
Well, you know, possibly.

168
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,949
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

169
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,787
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

170
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,362
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?

171
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,796
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl

172
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,059
I see.

173
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,034
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

174
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,142
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

175
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,607
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

176
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,481
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

177
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,155
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

178
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,383
Hey, Dragon!

179
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,594
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

180
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,564
There's $300 in this one.

181
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,235
People get generous
around the holidays.

182
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,804
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

183
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,245
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

184
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,314
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish

185
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,551
Why is nobody writing these?

186
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,083
We can remember them.

187
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:39,483
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

188
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,387
Sure, that too.

189
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,163
Forget the specials for a minute.
Here's the thing...

190
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,761
For the last two weeks I have...

191
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:56,569
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

192
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,276
Can't hear you!

193
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,077
Positive atmosphere.

194
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,909
But I've had it up to here.

195
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,649
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

196
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,518
...or the highway. All right?

197
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,295
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

198
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,531
Hey, new guy.

199
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,976
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

200
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,108
No, ma'am.

201
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,350
He has a name. It's Dragon.

202
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,123
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

203
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,688
We did the hat, right?

204
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,130
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.

205
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,764
I was going to do it.

206
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,562
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

207
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,137
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

208
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,775
...it's been a long time since I had...

209
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,840
...$327 plus $238!

210
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,945
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

211
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,811
And I got to pay rent!

212
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,953
How about you don't fire me.

213
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,787
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

214
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,328
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

215
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,961
What nice things?

216
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,727
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

217
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,009
Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica
Merry, merry

218
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,235
You know what, Pheebs?

219
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,247
I'm not Jewish so...

220
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,910
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

221
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,143
...but he's not complaining.

222
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,684
Bad dream?

223
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,519
I wasn't sleeping.

224
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,265
What was Phoebe's song about?

225
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,362
It's the one with the cat.

226
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:09,031
I got to go.
I've got another date.

227
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,940
Did you pick one yet?

228
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,111
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

229
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,548
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

230
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,985
So I'm still torn.

231
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,245
You don't like the one from uptown.

232
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,254
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

233
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,322
Just end them both!

234
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,257
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

235
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,295
Then break up with uptown.

236
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,162
By the time you get home,
you're done!

237
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,438
You're right. Thank you.

238
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,738
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

239
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,804
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.

240
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,789
Patrick just ended things with me.

241
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:11,094
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

242
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,499
I did! I absolutely did!

243
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,497
You idiot!

244
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,071
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

245
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:23,178
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

246
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,415
Now you scared him away!

247
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,518
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

248
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,813
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

249
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,318
I know, I know!

250
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,586
Now I'm right back where I started.

251
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,330
This sucks!

252
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,590
Being alone sucks!

253
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,201
You'll meet somebody.

254
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,335
You're a great catch!

255
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:51,440
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

256
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,109
Really?

257
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,849
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

258
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,010
It doesn't matter.

259
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,688
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

260
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,789
Cute guys in little shorts?

261
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,328
Sure.

262
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:19,366
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

263
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,096
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

264
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,232
Okay.

265
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,578
Have you ever been with a woman?

266
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,679
What? What is the matter with you?

267
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,515
There is no good time
to ask that question.

268
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,758
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

269
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,324
Ross? Ross?

270
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,332
Wake up!

271
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,009
I need more swordfish.

272
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,775
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.

273
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,616
-You just did.
-I don't know what to tell you.

274
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,327
Fine.

275
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,003
Okay. Very funny.

276
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,436
Let me out, please.

277
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,968
Come on, I'm cold!

278
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,215
And covered in marinara sauce!

279
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,812
Let me out!

280
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,284
You found that handle, did you?

281
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,252
-It's not funny.
-Well, that's not true.

282
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,730
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

283
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,996
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

284
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,969
If you want me
to quit this bad then

285
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,099
Chef Geller?

286
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,845
You know that speech you made?

287
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,305
I got a problem with it!

288
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,180
-You do?
-You bet I do!

289
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,819
I just wasn't listening then,
that's all.

290
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,354
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

291
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,527
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

292
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,635
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

293
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,701
Get out!

294
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,900
All right.

295
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,742
Anybody else got a problem?

296
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,273
How about you, chuckles?

297
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,946
You think this is funny now?

298
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:54,081
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

299
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,822
No, it's really good.

300
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,825
Take those salads to table four.

301
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,827
And you, get the swordfish!

302
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,499
And you!

303
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,497
Get a haircut!

304
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:14,242
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

305
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,912
What?

306
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,321
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

307
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,025
Now that I see them, I win!

308
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,696
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

309
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,669
Are we really in Montreal?

310
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,269
Yes, we are.

311
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,002
So coffee?

312
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,704
Coffee sounds great.

313
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,682
Wait.

314
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,854
So you live in Montreal?

315
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,718
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

316
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,858
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

317
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,363
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

318
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:16,235
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

319
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,743
Enough!

320
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,705
Lean, lean, lean!

321
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,484
So this is a very special holiday song...

322
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,388
...that I wrote for some very
important people to me.

323
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,457
Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap

324
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,827
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

325
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,995
Said all you need is
To write them a song

326
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,175
Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

327
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,480
No, don't sing along

328
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,878
Monica, Monica

329
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,346
Have a happy Hannukah

330
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,224
Saw Santa Claus

331
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,893
He said hello to Ross

332
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,930
And please tell Joey

333
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,498
Christmas will be snowy

334
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,030
And Rachel and Chandler

335
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,338
Happy holidays, everybody!
