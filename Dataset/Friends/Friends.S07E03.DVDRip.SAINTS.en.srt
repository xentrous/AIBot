1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,128
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,932
So, what do you think?

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,302
- About what?
- What?

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,745
Are you kidding?
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,215
Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,048
Chandler's eyes!

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,848
I got glasses.

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,390
You always had glasses.

9
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,597
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,298
Are you sure?

11
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,167
Didn't you have a pair?

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,432
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of...

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,540
- Feminine.
- Yes!

14
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,876
No.

15
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,774
I think the glasses look great.
You look sexy.

16
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,379
- Really?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,618
You didn't think I wore glasses?

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,353
Of course.

19
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:02,220
The One With Phoebe's Cookies

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,764
What do you want for
an engagement gift?

21
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,942
That's okay, we're not
having a party...

22
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,041
...so you don't have to get us...

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,814
If someone wants to give us a present,
we can't deprive them of that joy.

24
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,184
You should get them a
little CD player.

25
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,580
I already have one.

26
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,949
Unless someone borrowed it and
left it at the gynecologist.

27
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,327
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,962
I know what I want!

29
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,863
- What we want, honey.
- No, you don't want this.

30
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,363
I want your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

31
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,836
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?

32
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,272
The one my grandma
made me swear on her deathbed...

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,071
...that I would never
let out of our family?

34
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,751
Dying people say the craziest things.

35
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,485
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.

36
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,958
Break my heart. Oh, all right.

37
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,628
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.

38
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,993
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

39
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,337
Ahoy!

40
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,097
- How's the boat?
- I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

41
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,138
You finally took it out of the marina?

42
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,109
Why would I do that?

43
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,542
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

44
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,317
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?

45
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,246
It's a great place to just sit...

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,785
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

47
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,419
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.

48
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,356
I could teach you to sail if you want.

49
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,759
- You could?
- I've been sailing my whole life.

50
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,934
When I was 15, my dad
bought me my own boat.

51
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,429
- Your own boat?
- He was trying to cheer me up.

52
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,232
My pony was sick.

53
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,377
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,857
Nothing, I just like to go like this.

55
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,990
- What are you doing tonight?
- Do you have a lecture?

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,221
- No, why?
- Then, free as a bird. What's up?

57
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,159
My dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.

58
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,062
Great! Dad must like you!

59
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,861
He doesn't ask just anyone to play.

60
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,265
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for "Chauncey."

61
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,668
I assumed he meant you.

62
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,675
Did you correct him?

63
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,311
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.

64
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,080
Cool! Maybe you could
do this every week.

65
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,512
Or you could sit on the porch...

66
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,777
...and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.

67
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,413
He does that every week too.

68
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,354
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.

69
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,893
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

70
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,330
You're not a lefty?

71
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,328
Does anybody know me?

72
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,107
What's wrong?

73
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,607
I went to my old apartment
to get the cookie recipe...

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,212
...and that stupid fire burned it up!

75
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,112
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box...

76
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,220
...and keep it at least 100 yards
away from the original?

77
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,155
Because I'm normal.

78
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,367
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.

79
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,263
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

80
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,530
We have to get you
an engagement present?

81
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,668
Don't worry about it.

82
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,309
No one got me an engagement present.

83
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,311
I don't have the recipe, but here.

84
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,880
I wish you health
and happiness.

85
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,444
An old cookie?

86
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,121
This is what happens when you
don't register for gifts.

87
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,852
I made a batch and froze it.
This is the only one left.

88
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,257
We can't accept this.

89
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,396
Why not?

90
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,334
Because it's gross.

91
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,130
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

92
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,965
I do this at work all the time.

93
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,299
- Really?
- I think so!

94
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,876
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

95
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,344
Two! I've been engaged twice.

96
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,351
Look at this clown.

97
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,722
He thinks he can take up the
whole river.

98
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,523
Get out of the way, jackass!

99
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,794
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

100
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,033
That is the Coast Guard.

101
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,277
What are they doing here?

102
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,569
The coast is all the way over there.

103
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,879
Joey, just ignore the boats.

104
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,208
- We're not finished with our lesson.
- All right.

105
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,544
I'm gonna go over the basic
points once more.

106
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,652
Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?

107
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,514
I want to go over there...

108
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,919
...where that boatload of girls is.

109
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,795
Is that it? You want to give...

110
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,964
...a shout out to the hot chicas?

111
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,099
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.

112
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,337
Quick question, though:
What's this called?

113
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,641
- Boat rope?
- Wrong!

114
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,605
How do you get the mainsail up?

115
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,442
Rub it?

116
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,748
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

117
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,749
I say, "Come again?"

118
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,884
I know this one. I know this one.

119
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,754
Time's up. Now you're dead.

120
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,155
And deaf!

121
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,228
You go on and make your little jokes.

122
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,932
If you don't know
what you're doing...

123
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,295
...you will die.
Am I getting through to you?

124
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,229
- Yes.
- Don't just say yes.

125
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,839
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!

126
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,805
Do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

127
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,574
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

128
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,356
- I definitely taste nutmeg.
- You do?

129
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,929
You don't? Well, that's
the difference...

130
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,226
...between a
professional and a layman.

131
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,428
That and arrogance.

132
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,505
Hey.

133
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,207
Hey. How was sailing?

134
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,808
I don't want to talk about it.

135
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,673
You could've at least saved
me a cookie.

136
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,386
Women are mean!

137
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,118
I can't believe that.

138
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,557
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is...

139
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,264
...this crumb.

140
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,863
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

141
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,601
- Hey.
- How was it?

142
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,275
Well, I had a great time.

143
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,738
Chauncey, on the other hand...

144
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,845
I will tell the story.

145
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,015
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding...

146
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,013
...he even said I could call him Dad.

147
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,948
And what did he ask you
not to call him?

148
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,248
Daddy.

149
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,256
Look, here's the story.

150
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:53,428
We had just finished playing,
and we were gonna take a steam.

151
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,700
I walk into the room...

152
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,867
...and it's really steamy.

153
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,397
So I take off my glasses,
and that's when it happened.

154
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,609
Guys?

155
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,604
- Over here.
- Have a seat, son.

156
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,549
Hey!

157
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,389
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it.
- I know.

158
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,994
You gave my father a lap dance.

159
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,733
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

160
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,799
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.

161
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,111
Why?
Why did that have to happen?

162
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,416
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

163
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,880
Not that big a deal?

164
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,416
There was touching of things.

165
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,680
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...

166
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,950
...but did you have to bond
to that part?

167
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,756
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

168
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,465
He probably thought it was funny.

169
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,393
He'll be telling this story for years.

170
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,297
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

171
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,766
Oh, but he will.

172
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,476
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

173
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,303
I wasn't escaping.

174
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,642
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

175
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,411
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

176
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,349
You were trying to eat it.

177
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,253
If that is your father calling
to tell this story...

178
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,156
...then the marriage is off!

179
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,597
Come on. Hello.

180
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,631
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

181
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,665
I'll call you later, Dad.
I love you.

182
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,576
I'm off to see your dad.

183
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,744
Aren't you a little overdressed?

184
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,949
You better make sure
he tips you this time.

185
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,182
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore...

186
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,153
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

187
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,792
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.

188
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,792
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

189
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,196
Are you getting Monica and
Chandler a present?

190
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,668
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

191
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,431
Thank you!

192
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,400
Hey.

193
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,071
Well, hello.

194
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,009
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

195
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,244
I don't know the boat way
to say this, but never!

196
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,088
Why not?

197
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,587
Because you're mean on the boat.

198
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,921
I was just trying to teach you.

199
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,492
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.

200
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,457
Yep, yep, yep.

201
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,560
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

202
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,601
She wouldn't let me help at all.

203
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,672
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.

204
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,034
But you couldn't move...

205
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,107
...because you were wearing
three life jackets.

206
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,975
You have to respect the sea.

207
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,043
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

208
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,221
But I tell you, that was not mean.

209
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,220
My father is mean. He used to always
yell at me on the boat.

210
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,395
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.

211
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,394
Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead!"

212
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,466
Does a good student drink seven beers
during his first lesson?

213
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,163
Six and a half.

214
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,571
You knocked the last
one out of my hand, remember?

215
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,605
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

216
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,106
Well, it hit me anyway.

217
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,370
It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.

218
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:35,217
I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and stop yelling.

219
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,217
No bossing me around?

220
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,150
- I won't boss you around.
- And be nice?

221
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,949
- I'll be nice.
- You'll be topless?

222
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,393
- Joey!
- You want me to learn?

223
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:53,499
Here's batch 22.
Maybe these are like your grandma's.

224
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,469
This has a bit of orange peel,
but no nutmeg.

225
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,266
Let's give it a shot.

226
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,111
I haven't made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

227
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,837
What for, a bake sale?

228
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,845
No, just a Friday night.

229
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,516
These are pretty good.

230
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,587
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

231
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,793
Which one was that?

232
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,028
The ones we had after
you almost threw up.

233
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,088
Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.

234
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,335
I did not like batch 16.

235
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,294
I'm okay.

236
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,567
Any more from the good batch?
We could work off those.

237
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,075
I think there's one left.

238
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,683
Batch 16.
Sixteen, people, get out of the way!

239
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,457
Okay, Joey. You're doing really good.

240
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,790
I just need you
to step to the portside.

241
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,305
Remember talking about the portside?

242
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,008
Oh, yeah.

243
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,301
No.

244
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,473
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

245
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,011
Why not just say left?

246
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,876
Okay, go to the left.

247
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,021
The left.

248
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,157
Just sit over there!

249
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,485
You're yelling again. See that?

250
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,495
Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.

251
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:34,362
You know what? Since I'm here,
I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.

252
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,233
See what I did there?

253
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,710
We're luffing a little.
Can you tighten up the Cunningham?

254
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,808
You just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

255
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,578
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

256
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,720
We did that when that bird...

257
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,892
...flew over with the fish
in his mouth.

258
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,718
Did you see it? It was gross.

259
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,930
I did not see the bird or the fish!

260
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,132
I did not see the piece of
Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!

261
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,370
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

262
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,268
Which obviously is
an impossible thing to do.

263
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,444
You're yelling, and I don't
see you taking your top off.

264
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,111
I quit!

265
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,983
- What do you mean? You can't quit.
- Why not?

266
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,015
You're not finished! I won't have it.
Greens do not quit.

267
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,478
Greens?

268
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,690
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.

269
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,055
Oh, my God.

270
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,164
I just said, "Greens don't quit,"
didn't I?

271
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,561
Did I say, "Greens don't quit"?

272
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,702
Yes! And you're still yelling at me.

273
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,772
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.

274
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,738
Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.

275
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,535
Oh, my God. This is horrible.

276
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,344
I try so hard not to be my mother,
I didn't see this coming.

277
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,751
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.

278
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,761
I did learn.

279
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,229
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

280
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,934
It's okay.

281
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,967
I know what a mainsail is.

282
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,370
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

283
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,544
- I know port is right.
- Left.

284
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,973
Damn it!

285
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,448
What are we gonna do
with all these cookies?

286
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,614
Joey.

287
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,987
It would make my grandmother happy...

288
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,022
...that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

289
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,561
I bet she's looking up at us
and smiling right now.

290
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,864
Looking up?

291
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:48,472
She was really nice to me,
but she's in hell for sure.

292
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,299
Well, I've tried everything.

293
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,202
I give up.
I'm not gonna be the mom...

294
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,002
...who makes the world's
best cookies.

295
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:00,243
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoli raab.

296
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,577
Kids love that, right?

297
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,024
Isn't there any relative
that has the recipe?

298
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,657
What about your sister?

299
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,590
No. I made a promise to
myself that the next time...

300
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,799
...I would talk to Ursula
is over my dead body.

301
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,604
And that's not happening
till October 15, 2032.

302
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,999
That's the day you're gonna die?

303
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,242
I've got shuffleboard that day.

304
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,743
That's what you think.

305
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,980
What about friends of your grandma?
Wouldn't they have the recipe?

306
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,122
I may have relatives in France
who would know.

307
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:44,159
My grandmother said she got it from
her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse."

308
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:46,929
What was her name?

309
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,226
Nestley Toulouse.

310
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,232
Nestlé Toll House?

311
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,846
You Americans always butcher
the French language.

312
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,080
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

313
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,851
Yes!

314
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,916
Oh.

315
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,220
I cannot believe that I spent...

316
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,453
...two days figuring out that recipe.

317
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,095
It was here the whole time!

318
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,065
I know! You see,
it is stuff like this...

319
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,668
...which is why
you're burning in hell!

320
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,808
So you understand.

321
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,443
I'd feel better if you
didn't tell what happened.

322
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,442
I'm a little embarrassed about it.

323
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,479
I understand completely.

324
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,245
Nothing's scarier than embarrassing
yourself in front of your in-laws.

325
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,514
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unemployed.

326
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,920
Her father asked me
what I did for a living.

327
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,822
I said I was a lawyer.

328
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,390
- What'd you do when they found out?
- They never did.

329
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,262
So if you ever see me giving them
legal advice, just nod along.

330
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,864
Shall we?

331
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,117
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

332
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,128
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...

333
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,737
...your way of sailing
is a lot more fun.

334
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,368
Why don't you give a pull
on that rope?

335
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,646
We're not sailing.

336
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,949
- Just pull on it.
- All right.

337
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,088
Sandwiches!

338
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,823
What else?

339
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,291
Here you go.

340
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,561
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

341
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,862
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

342
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,263
Not like that. You're letting
all the good stuff fall out.

343
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,302
Careful!
You're wasting good pastrami!

344
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,638
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!
