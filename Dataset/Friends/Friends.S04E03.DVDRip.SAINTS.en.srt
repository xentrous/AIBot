1
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,361
We are so in luck!

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,132
Treeger said we could have
all this cool stuff!

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,734
Wait right there.

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,809
Oh, no. I'm paddling away.

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,318
Really? We got all this
rusty crap for free?

6
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:26,050
This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
And some of it is not even popped.

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,060
Could we be more white trash?

8
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,963
The One with the Cuffs

9
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,879
How desperate am I?

10
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,423
Good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.

11
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,919
I just told my mom
I'd cater her party.

12
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,391
-How come?
-I need the money.

13
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:41,293
It'd be a great way to get rid of
that last smidgen of self-respect.

14
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,230
I think this is a good thing.

15
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,304
Mom wouldn't have hired you
if you weren't good.

16
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,510
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.

17
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,479
Do you have any juice?

18
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,976
Just pickle.

19
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,252
Funny story.
I bumped into Joanna yesterday.

20
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,017
My boss, Joanna?
That must have been awkward.

21
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,854
Actually, she asked me
if I wanted a drink.

22
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,598
You didn't say yes to that,
did you?

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,535
Hello, Rachel.

24
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,533
Well, not at first.

25
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,743
What is she doing here?

26
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,089
Last time you went out with her
you said she was a dud!

27
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:42,124
I judged her too quickly. This
time, we took it to the next level.

28
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,892
Last time I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.

29
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,263
It's not an everyday occurrence!

30
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,996
Usually I'm in there by myself.

31
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,075
Promise.

32
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,384
-Rachel, aren't you running late?
-No

33
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,680
-You are if you pick me up a bagel.
-Okay.

34
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,183
Promise you will end this now.

35
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,324
-I promise. I'll end it.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,656
I hope you know what I'm giving up.

37
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,562
She's not just the boss in your office.
You know what I mean?

38
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,938
Sorry.
I knew what he meant.

39
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,008
How's the hired help?

40
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,881
Doing great.
Quiches are coming along.

41
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,176
What's this?
Blue nail polish?

42
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,184
I thought it was cute.

43
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,622
It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.

44
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,262
Let me ask you a question.

45
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,627
Why did you hire me?

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,798
Richard raved about
the food at his party...

47
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,732
...but you were sleeping with him.

48
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,272
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was nice.

49
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,374
I assume you didn't sleep
with anyone there.

50
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,877
At least that would be something.

51
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,251
Oh, my God!
Did you hear that?

52
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,144
She hired me because
she thinks I'm good.

53
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,917
I didn't hear that.

54
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,557
She didn't hire me out of pity.

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,995
It wasn't so she could pick on me.
She actually thinks I'm good.

56
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,803
And hey, it's cool
if you're a lesbian.

57
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,815
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?

58
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,826
Do you currently own
a set of encyclopedias?

59
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,969
No, but try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.

60
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,070
Actually, I'm not buying.
I'm selling.

61
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,173
Let me ask you one question.

62
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,167
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...

63
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:16,838
...and you just nod along,
not sure what they're talking about?

64
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,354
I'm telling you,
it's totally unconstitutional.

65
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,892
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

66
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,696
It was like the
Algonquin kids' table.

67
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,364
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

68
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,668
You haven't said anything
for about two minutes.

69
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,506
Are you at all interested?

70
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,510
Come on in.

71
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,552
-That's weird.
-What?

72
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,821
Your nails.

73
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,552
I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't
give me grief about biting them.

74
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,356
I meant, it's weird that
you only have nine now.

75
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,266
Oh, my God!

76
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,832
Wait a minute.

77
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,662
I had them when I put

78
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,939
Oh, my God!
It's in the quiche!

79
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,235
-Oh, my God!
-Okay, don't panic.

80
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,538
I'll go buy you a new set of nails.

81
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,240
No one will know,
and you'll look great!

82
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,879
It's because they're going to eat
That's the problem.

83
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,358
Honey, don't bite your nails.

84
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,092
Please don't freak out.

85
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,432
There's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.

86
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,137
And there's no way to know which one.

87
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,773
And whoever finds it wins the prize!

88
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,511
I'm not freaking out.

89
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,616
-Why are you laughing?
-Now your father owes me $5.

90
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,783
You bet I'd lose a nail?

91
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,252
Don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.

92
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,319
Frozen lasagnas?

93
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,127
You bet that I'd screw up?

94
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,257
All that stuff about how I was good

95
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,899
No, that was all true.

96
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,797
This was just in case
you "pulled a Monica."

97
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,972
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.

98
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,173
Come on.
Have a sense of humor.

99
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,810
You're never able to
laugh at yourself.

100
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,273
That's right.

101
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,145
My mom has no faith in me!
That's hilarious!

102
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,781
I don't get it.

103
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,286
No. I have faith.

104
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,289
No. You have lasagnas!

105
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,598
The ruined quiches are ready!

106
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,206
-I really don't think we
should be doing this. -Okay.

107
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,314
It just doesn't feel like
we're breaking up.

108
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,221
No, we are.
I'm sad.

109
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,864
Can you wait till tomorrow?
All right.

110
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,732
Unbelievable!

111
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,234
Thanks.

112
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,669
That was my boss.
I have to go.

113
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,007
What are you doing?

114
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,046
-I'm getting dressed.
-Why?

115
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,610
When I walk outside naked,
people throw garbage.

116
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,913
Wait.
I want to show you something.

117
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,580
What is it?

118
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,721
Just a little gag gift
somebody gave me.

119
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,856
Put your hands together.

120
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,229
You're not the boss of me.

121
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,731
Yeah, you are.

122
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,601
Saucy!

123
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,215
I'll be back in two minutes.

124
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,813
You're going to leave me like this?

125
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,151
Knowing you're here waiting for me.
I think it's exciting, don't you?

126
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,057
If you don't come back soon...

127
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,396
...there's pretty much
nothing I can do about it!

128
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,866
I brought you back a macaroon.

129
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,072
Great. I'll keep it in
my butt with your nose.

130
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,077
That's weird.
She locked the door.

131
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,341
You know why? She's got
the bonus list in there.

132
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,349
I saw her working on it today.

133
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,788
Swear you won't tell.

134
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,015
When Mark left, he gave me
a key to her office.

135
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,989
You want to see the list?

136
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,668
How are you?

137
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,126
Hello, Joanna

138
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,670
office.

139
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,939
I'm sorry.
I'll be a little longer.

140
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,668
-How little?
-A couple hours.

141
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,278
This isn't funny.
Get back here now!

142
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,642
-I can't!
-Why not?

143
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,681
I'm in my boss' car.

144
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,613
-What?
-Tunnel!

145
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,360
What?

146
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,268
Rachel, could I see you
for a moment?

147
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,641
Okay, here's the situation.

148
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,784
The keys to the cuffs
are on the door.

149
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,216
Could you be a doll...

150
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,789
...and grab them and
scoot on over here and unlock me?

151
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,757
And on a totally separate subject,
that's a lovely pantsuit.

152
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,194
You promised you would
break up with her.

153
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,500
I did break up with her!
She just took it really, really well!

154
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,202
Jeopardizing my career
never entered your mind?

155
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,879
It did enter my mind.

156
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:00,075
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.

157
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,353
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out.

158
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,725
I can't get myself right out of them.

159
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,726
You must have me confused with
the "Amazing Chandler"!

160
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:18,265
Unlock me! She could be gone
for hours, and I'm cold and...

161
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,436
All right! This is it!

162
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,336
Never see her again.

163
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,735
Never!

164
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,845
-Never come in here again.
-Fine!

165
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,183
Give me back my Walkman!

166
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,910
I never borrowed it.

167
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,751
Then I lost it.
Buy me one!

168
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,221
You got it! Here we go!
Come on. This is great!

169
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,389
Does it hurt?

170
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,800
No, I always see guys do this
when handcuffs are taken off.

171
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,970
Hello, sweet pants!

172
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,536
Wait!
What will you tell Joanna?

173
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,900
About what?

174
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:04,742
She'll see you're gone and know
I let you out, and I'll get fired!

175
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,884
I'll tell a lie!
I'm good at lying!

176
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,054
I actually did borrow your Walkman!

177
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,455
She'll know I have
a key to her office.

178
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,751
I've got to lock you back up.

179
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,061
I don't think so.

180
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,174
This is much better.

181
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,311
Here's somebody interesting.

182
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,912
What do you know about Van Gogh?

183
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,981
-He cut off his ear.
-And?

184
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,918
I'm out.

185
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,248
He painted that.

186
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,157
That's pretty nice.

187
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,462
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.

188
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,291
-What else you got in there?
-Let's see...

189
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,299
-Where does the Pope live?
-In the woods.

190
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,469
Wait, that's the joke answer.

191
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,636
Actually, it's Vatican City.

192
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,507
Now, what do you know about
vulcanized rubber?

193
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,545
Spock's birth control.

194
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,844
You need these books.

195
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,190
This used to be your room?

196
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,122
You must have been in
really good shape as a kid.

197
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,903
I'm such an idiot!

198
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,136
I can't believe I thought
she could change.

199
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,170
Who cares what your mom thinks?

200
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,641
So you "pulled a Monica."

201
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,876
I'm glad that's catching on.

202
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:49,214
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.

203
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,048
Prove your mother wrong.

204
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,193
You finish the job, and
we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

205
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,884
What?

206
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:02,726
If a kid gets straight A's, his
parents say, "You pulled a Monica."

207
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,098
A fireman saves a baby,
and they go, "He pulled a Monica."

208
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:14,076
Someone hits a homer, and they say,
"That one's out of here."

209
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,373
Because some things don't change.

210
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,782
All right.
I'll go down there.

211
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,920
I won't serve the lasagna.
I'll serve what I make.

212
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,957
My breasts are really strong.

213
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:47,441
I have to get you locked back up.
I'm so going to lose my job!

214
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,206
She's very private about her office!

215
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,581
Now I know why!

216
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,950
You're in trouble either way.

217
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,415
If she sees me locked to this...

218
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,319
...she'll know you were here.
You might as well let me go.

219
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,898
-I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
-Still won't be clean.

220
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,727
All I want is my freedom.

221
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,768
-Foot rubs for a month!
-Freedom!

222
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,840
-I'll put all your photos into albums!
-I want my freedom!

223
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,568
Why won't you hear me!
Sophie, help me!

224
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,440
Sophie, sit!

225
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,581
Would you just calm down?!

226
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,757
I'm going to say this
for the last time.

227
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,089
Would you please just

228
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,364
There's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.

229
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,371
In a minute.

230
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,677
So what do you say?

231
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,383
You get the whole set
of encyclopedias for $1200.

232
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,685
That works out to
just 50 bucks a book.

233
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,514
$1200?

234
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,325
You think I have $1200?

235
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,922
I'm home during the day...

236
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,326
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.

237
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,961
There's a few things
you don't get from book learning.

238
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,032
Well, what can you swing?

239
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,867
How about zero down and zero a month
for a long, long time?

240
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,244
You don't have anything?

241
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,379
You want to see what I got?

242
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,019
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

243
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,754
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

244
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,525
...a rock...

245
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,892
...and an army man.

246
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,199
Okay, I get the picture.
Thanks for your time.

247
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,161
And a fifty.

248
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,370
These must be Chandler's pants.

249
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,104
For $50 you can get one book.

250
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,172
What will it be?
A? B? C?

251
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,038
I'll stick with the V.

252
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,113
I want to see how
this bad boy turns out.

253
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,689
I will buy and wrap
all of your Christmas gifts!

254
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,583
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice
every morning!

255
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,294
-With extra pulp?
-Yeah.

256
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,795
I've got it!

257
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,465
You don't have it.

258
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,434
I have so got it!

259
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,201
There will be rumors about this.
No way to stop it.

260
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,403
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.

261
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,547
-How do they know?
-I called them.

262
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,281
When they ask me what I saw...

263
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,581
...I can be very generous...

264
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,418
...or very stingy.

265
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,993
Go on.

266
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,095
I can make you a legend.

267
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,835
I can make you
this generation's Milton Berle.

268
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,230
-And Milton Berle has
-Not compared to you.

269
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,307
They're not even
touching the lasagna.

270
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,913
They love your casserole!

271
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,749
It's hard to believe a while
ago this was just ingredients.

272
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,585
Everyone seems to like your dish.

273
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,116
And you?

274
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,456
I thought it was...

275
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,265
...quite tasty.

276
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,470
So if everyone liked it,
and you liked it...

277
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,037
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you...

278
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,173
A bitch?

279
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,712
I meant "wrong,"
but we can use your word.

280
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,342
Yes, well, I was wrong.

281
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,646
And I have to say...

282
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,888
...you really impressed me today.

283
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,053
You might even say that she
"pulled a Monica."

284
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,996
She doesn't know we switched it.

285
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,467
And the next time you cater for me...

286
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,300
...there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer.

287
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,470
That really means a lot.

288
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,073
Mom, don't bite your nails!

289
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,987
Hello, Chandler.

290
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,517
I love you.

291
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,226
What's going on?

292
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,930
No, he doesn't!

293
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,600
Two hours, that lasted.

294
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,043
So did you break up with Joanna?

295
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,540
I think so.

296
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,782
It's good you got out,
before she blew up like Vesuvius.

297
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,241
The volcano?

298
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:59,547
Speaking of volcanoes, man, are they
a violent igneous rock formation!

299
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,581
What?

300
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,523
Lava spewing, hot ash.

301
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,527
Of course, some are dormant.

302
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,758
Why are you talking about volcanoes
all of a sudden?

303
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,093
We don't have to.

304
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,703
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?

305
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,941
The vas deferens?

306
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,609
The Vietnam War?

307
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,210
Did anyone see that documentary
on the Korean War?

308
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,213
Korea's a beautiful country.

309
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,250
With such a sad history.

310
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,218
Could there be more Kims?

311
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,064
-Who's out there?
-Me! Good morning!

312
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,134
Could you come in here, please?

313
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,466
Sure! They didn't have
poppyseed bagels...

314
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,100
...so I have sesame
Oh, my word!

315
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,975
I've had a slight office mishap.

316
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,680
Could you get the key for me?

317
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,329
-If you could.
-Oh, I'm sorry!

318
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,795
You can tell your friend Chandler
we're definitely broken up this time!
