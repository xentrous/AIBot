1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:06,830
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,165
Happy birthday!

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,601
Rach, come on.

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,177
It's your birthday!

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:15,980
Hey...

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,542
She's not as pretty as
she was when she was 29.

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:26,224
Ms. Green wants to establish some
ground rules before she comes out.

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,656
She'd appreciate it if you didn't use
the words "old" or "downhill"...

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,261
...or "They still look
pretty damn good."

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,361
They do.

11
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,299
Rachel, come on out.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,364
Monica made breakfast.

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,940
Chocolate chip pancakes.

14
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,241
We've got presents.

15
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,477
Good ones?

16
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,314
They all came from the list
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

17
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,754
Can I keep the presents
and still be 29?

18
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,090
Come on, Rach, turning 30
is not that big a deal.

19
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,090
Really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,263
Why, God, why?

21
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:11,301
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me!

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,508
You know, I'm still 29 in Guam.

23
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,017
Hey, 30 is not that old.

24
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,847
Do you know how old the Earth is?

25
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,957
Late 30s?

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,694
You guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,424
No, it's not just you.
My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.

28
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,601
And now Chandler!

29
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,335
We're all getting so old.

30
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,008
Why are you doing this to us?

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,050
The One Where They All Turn Thirty

32
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,418
You're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

33
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,555
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

34
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,585
Your character is in a coma.

35
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,558
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

36
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,499
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...

37
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,999
...who've accomplished their goals
before they're 30.

38
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,900
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare
yourself to me.

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,170
- Come on, Phoebe!
- You can do it!

40
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,544
- Come on.
- There you go.

41
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,879
I did it!
One mile on a Hippity Hop.

42
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,492
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

43
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,489
Except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

44
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,821
Oh, well. But, yeah!

45
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,291
Girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean.

46
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,981
Thirty. Oh, I mean, 30.

47
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,016
Monica, you remember mean, old
Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was 30.

48
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,054
Let's have some fun.
What do you want to do?

49
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,951
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

50
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,892
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.

51
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,823
That was a practical purchase.

52
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,728
I needed that car for transportation.

53
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,233
Okay? I have a child.

54
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,863
How hot do I look in this?

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,109
Ross, a sports car?

56
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,541
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

57
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,315
That's not what this is about.

58
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,711
I am a sports car enthusiast.

59
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,480
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower?

60
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,152
I don't know, but look how shiny!

61
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:27,558
- I can't believe you bought this.
- Really. God, Ross, what were you thinking?

62
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,531
I know it's really shallow,
but part of me wants him again.

63
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,297
Well, get in line, missy.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,564
So can I have a ride, stud?

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,204
Hop in.

66
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,980
Get ready for the
smoothest ride of your life.

67
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,599
Damn it.

68
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,202
Okay, who's next?

69
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,243
I am gonna do something today. I'm not
just gonna sit around like some old lady.

70
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,747
I want to get something pierced.

71
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,113
Like my nose or my tongue or something.

72
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,947
Really? Because that hurts.

73
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,952
So what?
The way I see it...

74
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,591
Son of a bitch!

75
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,964
Look, I know what
you're going through.

76
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,327
I'm totally freaked out
about turning 25.

77
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,468
Get out of my apartment.

78
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,807
Rach, I think that you're doing great.

79
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,739
Let's face it,
no one handles this well.

80
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,808
Least of all you.

81
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,241
- Why, what did you do?
- Weren't you asked to leave, sonny?

82
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,584
Put that back on.
Monica will be here any minute.

83
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,887
But it hurts my Joey's apple.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,894
For the last time, it's not named
after each individual man.

85
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,309
You've done a wonderful job with this
party, Chandler. Everything's so lovely.

86
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,012
Well, not as lovely as you.

87
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,511
I can't believe you have a
30-year-old daughter.

88
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,380
And I can't believe you have
a tux that's 30 years old.

89
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,555
It's older than that. Ross was actually
conceived right near this tuxedo.

90
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,462
Everybody hide! I saw her.
She's coming.

91
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,162
Everybody down!

92
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,467
Crap.

93
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,842
Everybody stay here.
I'll find out what's going on.

94
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,440
Hey, you got the door open!

95
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,210
Hey, are you drunk?

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,578
No.

97
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,948
Okay.

98
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,357
Okay.

99
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,995
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...

100
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,598
...30.

101
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,405
So the busboys took me out
for some drinks.

102
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,977
Might want to puke on you later.

103
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:32,177
Here's the thing. We've thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.

104
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,148
- Your friends are in there,
and your parents. - No!

105
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,353
- Yes! Yes!
- No.

106
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,649
Oh, no! My parents have never
seen me drunk.

107
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,320
That they know of.

108
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,288
We'll get you some coffee.
They'll never know that you're drunk.

109
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,898
- You promise?
- I'll take care of it.

110
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,068
I love you so much.

111
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,202
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

112
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,372
What about your breath?

113
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,345
That's still yours.

114
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,711
Now remember,
it's a surprise party.

115
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,180
So when you go in, act surprised.

116
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,647
Ready?

117
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,890
Surprise!

118
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,495
Okay, forward. Forward.

119
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,831
Stop!

120
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,832
Okay, back... Stop!

121
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,042
Okay, for... Stop!

122
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,737
Stop! Stop!

123
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,013
Ross, just forget about it.
The guy's got you totally wedged in.

124
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,989
- Is this yours?
- No, it's mine! It's mine.

125
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,017
Dude, you so need this car.

126
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,222
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

127
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,194
I'll break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.

128
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,097
You push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

129
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,033
All right. Here we go.

130
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,240
Haul ass!

131
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,825
Happy 30th birthday! Here.

132
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,760
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.

133
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,659
Happy 30th!

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,596
Right. Why do you keep saying that?

135
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,165
Because it's our 30th birthday.

136
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,567
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.

137
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,704
Wait.

138
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,170
Oh, it's you.

139
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,007
Yeah. What?

140
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,150
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.

141
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,153
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

142
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,856
You have a birth certificate?

143
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,854
I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.

144
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,755
Our mom.

145
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,054
Right. Okay.

146
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,734
- Do you have mine?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.

147
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,702
Oh, my God.

148
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,609
Oh, my God, we are 31!

149
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,309
Yeah.

150
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,974
I just lost a whole year of my life.

151
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,374
Okay.

152
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,217
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.

153
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,320
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

154
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,625
Yes. Phoebe.

155
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,489
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.

156
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,865
We made it across the room.
You're doing great.

157
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,259
What's going on?

158
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,971
Monica's a little drunk.

159
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,241
Yeah! I love drunk Monica.

160
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,804
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.

161
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,884
She doesn't want her parents to know.

162
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,319
All right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.

163
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,321
I'll get twice as drunk,
then no one will even notice her.

164
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,896
- Drunk Phoebe's mean.
- Okay, you watch your tone with me!

165
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,500
What's going on?

166
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,496
Monica's wasted.

167
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,207
Maybe that will liven up this party.

168
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,139
Will you just help her get changed?

169
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,675
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems like a job for Joey.

170
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,283
This one's from me.

171
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,022
It wasn't on your list,
but it's really fun.

172
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,283
A scooter.

173
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,122
Stick to the list.

174
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,633
Always stick to the list.

175
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,634
No, no, I love it. Thank you.

176
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,505
Open ours next! Open ours next!

177
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,108
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two gifts?

178
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,313
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.

179
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,149
Read the card! Read the card!

180
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,048
"Happy birthday, Grandma.

181
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,885
It's better to be over the hill...

182
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,553
...than buried under it.

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,501
All our love, Monica and Chandler."
That's funny.

184
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,998
No, no. That was a joke.

185
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,866
I know, I get it. It's funny.

186
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,973
Because you're not a grandma.

187
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,578
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have children.

188
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:33,046
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

189
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,017
I'm just gonna go...

190
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,087
All you had to do was buy the card.

191
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,566
Hey, look who's back.
It's the birthday girl.

192
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,364
How's the birthday girl feeling?

193
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,606
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're
bumming out the rest of the kids.

194
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,145
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.

195
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,545
All I really needed was a plan.

196
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,681
See, I want three kids.

197
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,757
And you want to have them all at the
same time and have them for your brother.

198
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,122
As I was saying...

199
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,726
I should have the first one
by the time I'm 35.

200
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,993
Which gives me five years.

201
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,597
I love this plan. I'm
gonna marry this plan.

202
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,503
If you could do that,
I'd marry the Hippity Hop.

203
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,580
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

204
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,340
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.

205
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,817
But I want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

206
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,022
Really? That long?

207
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,496
Look all you want, it's happening.

208
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,239
I don't have to get married until
I'm 33. That's three whole years.

209
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,668
Wait a minute, though.

210
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,343
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.

211
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,444
And I'd like to know the guy
for a year, year and a half...

212
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,717
...before we get engaged.

213
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,713
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

214
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,790
Which is fine
because you just turned...

215
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,689
...28!

216
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,858
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

217
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,466
I should already be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.

218
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,109
Will you quit hogging it?

219
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,814
I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.

220
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,619
You're drunk.

221
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,357
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

222
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,259
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

223
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,127
Are those crab cakes?

224
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,927
Did I not tell you to come straight to
me when more crab cakes were ready?

225
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,436
How you feeling?

226
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,901
You are so handsome.

227
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,976
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.

228
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,349
I really wish that you wouldn't.

229
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:34,165
Just get through a little bit more,
then we can put you in bed.

230
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,300
Just smile and don't talk to anyone.

231
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,633
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girl.

232
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,641
Pheebs!

233
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,775
See, everybody's looking at me.

234
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,377
The plan's working.

235
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,346
I didn't even have to
take off my top yet.

236
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,715
Speech. Come on, speech!

237
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,353
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.

238
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,060
I think it's nice.

239
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,126
I think it's necessary.

240
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,700
I want to thank you all for coming.

241
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,767
My family and...

242
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:18,975
...my friends.

243
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,515
I'd really like to say that I'm...

244
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,116
You know what I'd really like to say?

245
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,414
I'm drunk!

246
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,689
That's right, Mom and Dad.

247
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,159
Your little Harmomica is hammered.

248
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,566
And guess what?

249
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,736
I've been drunk before.

250
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,937
And I've smoked a cigarette.

251
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,667
And I've had a box of Ding Dongs
hidden in my underwear drawer.

252
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,372
It's all okay.
It's okay because...

253
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,413
...I turned 30 today.

254
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,921
And I can do anything I want.

255
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,119
Because I am a grownup.

256
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,325
Okay, quick. Help me get this off.

257
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,603
I lost a whole year.

258
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,341
I can't believe it.
This is so unfair!

259
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,440
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.

260
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,871
Will it? Will it?

261
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,704
How would you feel if
you found out you were 31?

262
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,579
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deal.

263
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,812
Plus, it ruined my schedule.

264
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,891
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31.

265
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:46,223
- Like what? - Like I haven't
met any Portuguese people.

266
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,966
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

267
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,327
And I haven't been to sniper school.

268
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,341
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake.

269
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,609
I just feel like being by myself for
a while. See you guys later. Thanks.

270
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,043
Poor Pheebs.

271
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,017
Hey, you know what, you guys? I think
I'm gonna walk her home.

272
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,724
- Oh, man.
- What?

273
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,824
He's gonna eat the cake.

274
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,891
Pheebs!

275
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,626
Listen, I...

276
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,522
Close your eyes.

277
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,579
That's one thing you can
cross off your list.

278
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,916
Oh, yeah.

279
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,515
Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

280
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,586
Okay, is everybody clear?

281
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,729
We're gonna pick it up...

282
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,165
...and move it.

283
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,602
All we need is teamwork.
We're gonna lift the car...

284
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,501
...and slide it out.

285
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,405
Lift...

286
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,410
...and slide.

287
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,511
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...

288
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,748
...and slide.

289
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,786
All right. Come on, dogs,
let's lift this sucker.

290
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,463
Oh, unless you're scared.
Little weaklings scared?

291
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,962
Good teamwork.

292
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,334
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.

293
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,127
Lift...

294
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,775
...and slide.

295
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,410
- Hey, Joey...
- Come on, Rach, my turn just started.

296
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,744
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.

297
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,821
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

298
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,025
Whatever. I'm not your mother.

299
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,620
Not in the street!

300
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,260
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm...

301
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,900
Let's talk.

302
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,507
What's up?

303
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,244
Oh, Tag...

304
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,678
You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.

305
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,041
- But I...
- Wait.

306
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,883
I think I see where you're going.

307
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,646
But before you say anything else,
can I say one more thing?

308
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,127
Well said.

309
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,596
And a good example of the fun
I was referring to.

310
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:46,707
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.

311
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,279
Rachel, don't do this. This is just
because you're turning 30.

312
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,880
Yeah, it is.

313
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,778
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

314
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,649
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.

315
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,757
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.

316
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:10,262
Well, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I actually wish I was six years younger.

317
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,931
- Me too.
- Yeah. Sorry.

318
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,842
Hey, how'd it go?

319
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,653
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

320
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,785
You did the right thing.

321
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,220
I don't like this anymore.

322
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,000
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.

323
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,301
Do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?

324
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,013
Why, God?

325
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,750
Why are you doing this to us?

326
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,826
Yes! My baby's finally free.

327
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,323
All right!

328
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,893
Start it up. Let's go!

329
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,006
How hot are we?

330
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,381
You want to buy a car?
