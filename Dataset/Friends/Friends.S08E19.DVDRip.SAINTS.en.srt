00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:07,501
Hi. So I'm doing the Soap Opera
Digest crossword puzzle...

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,302
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,947
"Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,911
That's me! I'm blank!

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,349
How cool! We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,147
Yeah, you are, baby.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,122
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,829
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,589
No. They wanted to do
a profile on me. I said no.

10
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,165
Why'd you say no?

11
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,871
Remember the last interview I did?

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,403
I said I write my own lines,
the writers got mad...

13
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:47,135
...and I fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what I'd say now?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,783
If only there was something
in your head to control what you say.

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,953
Come on, you'll keep it
in check this time.

16
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:59,352
The publicity would be good for you.
You deserve that.

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,895
In the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:09,090
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

19
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,636
- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
- Fine, all right, I'll do it.

20
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,900
You have to be there to stop me
if I say something stupid.

21
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:23,707
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

22
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,018
We'll be there the whole time.
Just remember:

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,348
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

24
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:37,758
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!
And not just in the dumb crossword.

25
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,124
Seriously, proud of you.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,869
The One With Joeys Interview

27
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:23,435
- Thanks for taking the time for this.
- Not at all. Happy to do it.

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,838
You think we're being obvious?

29
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:31,073
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

30
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,342
It's great that we met here.

31
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,354
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.

32
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,192
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

33
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:48,124
Wouldn't have mattered. I do this
for the fans, not the free food.

34
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,700
- Can I get you anything?
- Coffee.

35
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,837
And I'll have all the muffins.

36
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,875
- Hey.
- We're not talking.

37
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,273
Oh, finally.

38
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:07,181
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.

39
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,618
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

40
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,820
All you want is a dingle

41
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,895
What you envy's a shwang

42
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,259
A thing through which you can tinkle

43
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,368
Or play with, or simply let hang

44
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,649
This ever happen?
You want a glass of milk...

45
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,948
...but these darn cartons
are so hard to open!

46
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,921
Boy, you said it, Mike.

47
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,955
- There's gotta be a better way!
- There is, Kevin!

48
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,397
This is the first time
he's ever used this. It's easy.

49
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,174
- This works in any milk carton.
- It is easy.

50
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,741
Now I can have milk every day.

51
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,706
So this is it, Victor?

52
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,647
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

53
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,521
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

54
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:29,431
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

55
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:35,936
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

56
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,609
But I won't have aged at all.

57
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:46,449
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

58
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,455
Because, Adrian...

59
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,418
...baby...

60
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,320
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

61
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,334
Here I come.
I'm coming to fix the copier.

62
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,873
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

63
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,010
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

64
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,379
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

65
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,321
- Nice work, my friend.
- Wait, you see me again.

66
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,493
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

67
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,697
There I am. There I am. There I am.

68
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,497
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.

69
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,729
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?

70
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,933
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte.

71
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,545
- A bagel with only...
- I was just being polite.

72
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,649
How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?

73
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:01,055
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.

74
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,592
Get out of the way, jackass!

75
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,858
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

76
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,000
That is the Coast Guard.

77
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,607
What are they doing out here?
The coast is way over there!

78
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,140
This is unbelievable.

79
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,009
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

80
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,584
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

81
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,594
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

82
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,791
- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
- Come on, it's fun!

83
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,570
All right.

84
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,940
Isn't this a woman's hat?

85
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,483
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

86
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,115
We have to turn off the porn.

87
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,323
I think you're right.

88
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,321
- All right, ready?
- One.

89
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,158
- Two, three.
- Three.

90
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,868
That's kind of nice.

91
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,300
- It's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,681
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,976
Free porn! We have free porn here!

94
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,389
In my spare time, I read to the blind.

95
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,818
And I'm also a mento for kids.

96
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,892
- A mento?
- You know, a mento. A role model.

97
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,667
- A mento?
- Right.

98
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,269
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

99
00:07:55,541 --> 00:08:01,070
Our readers always want to know how
soap stars stay in such great shape.

100
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,612
Do you have a fitness regime?

101
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,412
We stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

102
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,185
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?

103
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,586
Are you serious?

104
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:19,730
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to jinx it.

105
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,400
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,332
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

107
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,199
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

108
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,038
My pants are a little loose.

109
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,411
What's wrong with you?

110
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:40,381
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights.

111
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,178
And then I passed out.

112
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:48,382
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's serious.

113
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,858
Sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

114
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,324
No way!

115
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:58,970
If I go to the doctor, it's for this
thing sticking out of my stomach!

116
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,133
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

117
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,878
Damn you, fifteens!

118
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,911
- What is it?
- A trifle. It has layers.

119
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,345
A layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

120
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,645
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

121
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:21,518
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sautéed with peas and onions.

122
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,491
Then a little bit more custard.

123
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,531
It tastes like feet.

124
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,699
I like it.

125
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,208
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

126
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,310
Jam, good. Meat, good!

127
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,513
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

128
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,419
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

129
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,148
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

130
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,885
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

131
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,927
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

132
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,828
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

133
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,527
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

134
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,180
All right, what are we having?

135
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:28,118
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.

136
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,022
Your muffins.

137
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,998
I'll take those to go.

138
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,530
For the kids.

139
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,562
I know what I wanted to ask.

140
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,605
They killed you off years ago.
What happened there?

141
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,874
I said some stuff in an interview
I shouldn't have said.

142
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:53,117
- But that is not gonna happen today.
- Understood.

143
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:57,117
- So, what'd you say back then?
- I said that I...

144
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,154
- Hey, Joey!
- How you doing?

145
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,855
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.
Shelly, these are my friends.

146
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:12,001
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
If you want the dirt, come to me.

147
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,901
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

148
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,471
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

149
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,705
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

150
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,578
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.

151
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,652
- You're doing great.
- So far, nothing stupid.

152
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,791
- Mento?
- No, thanks.

153
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:40,729
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?

154
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,799
No, just that he is a great guy.

155
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,869
That'll get you
into Soap Opera Digest.

156
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,438
Well, I...

157
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,700
I'd like to say that Joey...

158
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:55,403
...truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

159
00:11:55,981 --> 00:12:00,213
I think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

160
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,820
- I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.

161
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:10,051
- How do you spell that?
- It's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.

162
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,423
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

163
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:17,466
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"

164
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,397
Great. It was nice meeting you.

165
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,301
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks.

166
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,377
It seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?

167
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,414
How come you have two?

168
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,414
Well, this one's for you.

169
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,352
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

170
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:46,595
I know how much this means to you.
This isn't just about jewelry.

171
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,827
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

172
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,666
Is this friendship? I think so!

173
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,672
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

174
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,311
That's what they'll call us!

175
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:08,146
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

176
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,720
That's gonna leave a stain.

177
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,756
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

178
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,818
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

179
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,332
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know!

180
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,675
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

181
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,249
I feel guilty.
I wanna be a good friend...

182
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,011
...and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

183
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,983
You are a good friend.

184
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,858
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

185
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,593
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

186
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,936
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

187
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,907
And they're off!

188
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,279
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge!

189
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,984
Judge rules: No violation.

190
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:18,683
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! That's just an old won ton.

191
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,392
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

192
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,754
Tough call.

193
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,693
- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
- Wait a minute. I saw that!

194
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,769
Yeah, about jellyfish,
and how if you...

195
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,471
You peed on yourself?

196
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,975
You can't say that! You don't know!

197
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,152
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

198
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,687
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

199
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,888
So...

200
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,395
That's right, I stepped up!

201
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,408
She's my friend and she needed help!

202
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,101
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you!

203
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,117
Nope. No best friend.

204
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,150
Just a lot of close friends.

205
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,524
So now back to the show.

206
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,752
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

207
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,021
Really? Me?

208
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,325
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

209
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,004
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

210
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,568
Now, off the record, you're not...

211
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,705
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

212
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,748
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.

213
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,922
It's got compartments for stuff:
Your wallet, your keys.

214
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,216
Your makeup.

215
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,826
Should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

216
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:10,366
...or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

217
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,201
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face.

218
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,437
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

219
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,437
Oh, my...
How much do you weigh, Ross?

220
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:28,709
I prefer not to answer that. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

221
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:41,394
When we said "face to face," we didn't
think it all the way through!

222
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,533
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

223
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,803
Check it out.

224
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,206
How much of a man am I?

225
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,780
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

226
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,279
You're turning into a woman.

227
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,624
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?
That's just mean!

228
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,421
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

229
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,292
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

230
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,468
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

231
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,379
- Great nap.
- It really was.

232
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,455
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

233
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,097
But I have a number
of close friends who are.

234
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,468
So let's talk about women.

235
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,436
I'm sure our female readers are
interested in your romantic life.

236
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,271
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

237
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,041
"Hey. How you doing?"

238
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,576
Oh, please.

239
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,652
Hey. How you doing?

240
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,588
Hey. How you doing?

241
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,629
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

242
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,234
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

243
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,703
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

244
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,580
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, my God! Jill!

245
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,785
- Oh, my God! Rachel!
- Oh, hi!

246
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,046
- Oh, my God! Introduce us!
- Well, this is Chandler.

247
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,987
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

248
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,288
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't!

249
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:59,635
You're a really nice guy. I'm happy
to be your roommate and friend.

250
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:04,775
I'm just... You know, I just
don't feel that way about you.

251
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,480
I see what happened.

252
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,116
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

253
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:18,551
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

254
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,521
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

255
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,653
How you doing?

256
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,364
I'm okay.

257
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,568
What? Oh, dear God!

258
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,774
Not much to tell there.
I'm really shy.

259
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,909
So that's it.
I guess that's all I need.

260
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:49,076
Thank you so much.
I think they'll run this next month.

261
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,221
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

262
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,789
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,118
- I did it.
- Amazing.

264
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,390
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

265
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,933
Other than Days,
what's your favorite soap opera?

266
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,700
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

267
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:17,777
The readers at Soap Opera Digest
will be happy to learn that.

268
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,574
Good enough.

269
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,746
So close.

270
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,154
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.

271
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,835
I called the lady and said I
was joking. She was nice about it.

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,164
- You slept with her, didn't you?
- A little bit.

273
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,172
This picture of you is steamy.

274
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,608
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

275
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,875
- Did you just wink at me?
- You're the one who loves the picture.
