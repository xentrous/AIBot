1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,700
Oh, hey! How was your audition?

2
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,342
I'm sorry, do I know you?

3
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,040
What are you doing?

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,738
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:17,814
You got it?

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:21,475
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,180
A big-budget period movie
about three Italian brothers...

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,054
...who come to America at the
turn of the century. It's classy.

9
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,198
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

10
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,160
The "next-next"?

11
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,033
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

12
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,138
This guy's right after him.

13
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,343
Hello?

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,074
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

15
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,285
They loved me!

16
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,919
They want to see you again tomorrow.

17
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,057
- My God!
- There's just one thing.

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,920
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

19
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,258
Are you kidding me? I never
rent a movie without it!

20
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,167
Oh.

21
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,605
Okay, let me call you back.

22
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:18,343
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,704
- Wow!
- I know.

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,848
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

25
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:30,579
The One With Ross
and Monica's Cousin

26
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,114
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

27
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,090
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

28
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,129
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

29
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,892
A "no sex" pact, huh?

30
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:19,096
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

31
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,133
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

32
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,778
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

33
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,176
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

34
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,217
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

35
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,785
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

36
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,422
You're probably right.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,558
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

38
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,596
Subtle, guys.

39
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,957
What?

40
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,965
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

41
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,837
Okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

42
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,874
Okay. Sorry.

43
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,405
We have to throw her a shower?

44
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,220
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

45
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,321
I don't know. I mean...

46
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:16,827
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

47
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,327
Nudity's really important
to the story.

48
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,592
That's what you say about porn.

49
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,666
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

50
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,807
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

51
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,374
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

52
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:36,972
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

53
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,151
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

54
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,854
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

55
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,151
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,453
It's really sweet and tender.

57
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,755
Plus, everyone will see your thing!

58
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,492
When can we have this shower?

59
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,797
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

60
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,805
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

61
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,911
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

62
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,309
If we make it yesterday, we're done!

63
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,848
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

64
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,553
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

65
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,881
There's too much to do.

66
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,990
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,629
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,320
Just calm down, woman!

69
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,798
Phoebe, I already did.

70
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,300
All right, then I need to calm down.

71
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,503
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

72
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,840
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.

73
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,981
Where will we have it?

74
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,184
- Here. What time?
- 4:00. Food?

75
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,444
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Great! Very Monica.

76
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,952
- And chili!
- You went one too far.

77
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,316
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,528
- We're paying for this.
- Neither.

79
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,895
- What should we do for a theme?
- Lusts of the Flesh!

80
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,563
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

81
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,169
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

82
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,345
Oh, boy. Me too.

83
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,181
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
and broke up for a few hours.

84
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,257
Technically, we could have sex again.

85
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:30,059
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

86
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,857
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

87
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,327
That's me. Come on.

88
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,764
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

89
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,029
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

90
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,406
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

91
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,705
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

92
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,249
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

93
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,316
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

94
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,699
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

95
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,511
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

96
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:23,476
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

97
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,740
Chandler, she's our cousin!

98
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,818
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.

99
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,320
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

100
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,886
Say something.

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,127
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

102
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,595
Fine. She can stay at my place.

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,859
What does Cassie look like now?

104
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,661
Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.

105
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,505
This Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,572
Wafer-thin ice.

107
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:56,949
Hey, I'm back.

108
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,879
Hi, Joey.

109
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,383
Will I read the same scene again?

110
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,556
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

111
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,315
Oh, great.

112
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,591
I'd have been perfect for this part.

113
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,060
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

114
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,962
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

115
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,307
And, scene.

116
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,740
Wasn't that fun? We did
a little improv there. Yeah!

117
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,506
So, you were saying?

118
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,277
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,451
Wow! Sure! That's great.

120
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,850
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

121
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,993
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

122
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,492
And that barn is not too cold.

123
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,064
Perfect. There's one more thing.

124
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,801
It's important to the director that
everything in the movie's authentic.

125
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,169
In your love scene with Sarah...

126
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:02,575
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

127
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,908
So...

128
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,113
So... what?

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,950
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

130
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,788
...be authentically, anatomically...

131
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:19,522
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

132
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,165
Yes!

133
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,962
No. What?

134
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,667
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be...

135
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,102
Bar mitzvah-ed?

136
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,479
Think 13 years earlier, lose the rabbi,
add a scalpel.

137
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,852
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

138
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,959
But you are?

139
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,562
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.

140
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,590
Wow!

141
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,198
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

142
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,143
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

143
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,281
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

144
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,009
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

145
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,244
You figure out how to do it later.

146
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:21,351
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning...

147
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,494
...to grow a turtleneck.

148
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:34,431
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

149
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,837
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

150
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,568
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

151
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,547
I have to call my agent
and tell her I can't do the part.

152
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,415
Unless...

153
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,087
Unless what?

154
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,385
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

155
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,685
...fashion.

156
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,566
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

157
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,166
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

158
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,569
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

159
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,678
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

160
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,548
We get mahogany boxes
and carve everyone's names in them.

161
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,317
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.

162
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,187
Okay. Okay.

163
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,800
You take care of that.

164
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,369
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

165
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,907
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

166
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,672
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

167
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:53,147
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

168
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,917
Have at it.

169
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,057
All right. Turkey? That won't work.

170
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,557
Cheese? That won't work.

171
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,160
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

172
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,728
Are you making him a sandwich?

173
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,333
No, it's more like a wrap.

174
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,833
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.

175
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:22,377
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

176
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,675
We have to get her a present?

177
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,379
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

178
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,718
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

179
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,625
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

180
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,290
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

181
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,173
Cassie?

182
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,245
Hey, Ross!

183
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,846
It's been so long!

184
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,150
Last time I saw you...

185
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,914
...you were setting up your tent
in line for Return of the Jedi.

186
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,352
That's right.

187
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,858
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

188
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,564
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

189
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,601
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

190
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,070
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.

191
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,490
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

192
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,801
I have a knack for impressions.

193
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,031
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
you could do me.

194
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:58,504
Yeah. No!

195
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,980
How you doing on that...

196
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,588
...hot dog?

197
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,559
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

198
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,860
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

199
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,766
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

200
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,401
We're probably too old to do that now.

201
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:40,175
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

202
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,616
I'll always remember that summer...

203
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,385
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

204
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,127
You know, we're not just
two random people thrown together.

205
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,698
We share genetic material.

206
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,967
It took you that long
to figure it out?

207
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,995
I'm a little slow.

208
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,772
Just as our children would be.

209
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,242
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,454
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

211
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,952
Thank you. So nice to see you.

212
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,888
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

213
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,426
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

214
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:28,031
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

215
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,930
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

216
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,197
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

217
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,076
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

218
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,771
- How do you know Monica?
- I was her accountant four years ago.

219
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:48,783
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

220
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,278
That's great.

221
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:56,253
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

222
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,857
Excuse us.

223
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,734
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

224
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,565
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

225
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,634
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

226
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:22,378
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

227
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,153
Those look great.

228
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,191
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.

229
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,022
- The toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

230
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,357
Thank God.

231
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,729
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

232
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,597
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

233
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,207
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

234
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,775
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

235
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:52,476
I also did a little something in fur,
but that's really just for me.

236
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,380
Why don't you try these on? We'll
get a better idea of what works.

237
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,992
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

238
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,926
Okay, the taffy's too sticky.

239
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,034
I was afraid of that.

240
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,670
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,777
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

242
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,844
- And?
- Delicious.

243
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,612
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

244
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,117
What? Which one?

245
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:34,587
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

246
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:48,539
She's your cousin.
She's your cousin.

247
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:54,406
If she knew what was going on in
your head, she'd think you were sick.

248
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:04,211
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.

249
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,951
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.

250
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,994
She was the one who
turned down the lights.

251
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,758
She was the one that wanted to rent
Logan's Run...

252
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,766
...the sexiest movie ever.

253
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,005
I know that look.

254
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,339
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.

255
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,013
I'm going in.

256
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,082
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,792
Say something clever.

258
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,962
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.

259
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,830
Just has to be words. Say some words.

260
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,631
Any words will do.

261
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,843
Oh, my God, this is the longest...

262
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:05,278
...that anyone has not talked ever!

263
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,613
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...

264
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,790
...so just say something!

265
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,389
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

266
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,695
Yeah, you really shouldn't
have said anything.

267
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,467
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

268
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,702
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

269
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,812
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

270
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,581
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

271
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:48,189
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

272
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,893
You already had it?

273
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,498
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

274
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,467
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

275
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,664
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

276
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,706
Now you don't have either.

277
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,276
We ruined everything.

278
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,973
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

279
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,551
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?

280
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:20,020
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

281
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,922
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

282
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,503
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

283
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,271
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

284
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,812
My whole family's from Naples.

285
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:49,851
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear...

286
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,385
We just need to, uh...

287
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,956
Leslie?

288
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,586
- Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Hey, right. Not a problem.

289
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,992
I totally understand you need...

290
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:05,101
...to make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

291
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,463
Don't you worry.

292
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,471
I have nothing to hide.

293
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,538
So, there you go. That's me.

294
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,973
One hundred percent natural.

295
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,365
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

296
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,336
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

297
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,203
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me stay here.

298
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,435
Oh, it's no problem.

299
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,828
What?

300
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,797
Say something. Say anything.

301
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,792
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
